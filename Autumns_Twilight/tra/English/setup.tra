However, it was reinforced by Fall's mother, a powerful elven selu'taar from Cormanthyr. Even though it has a bright reddish color, this does not prevent its wearer from blending into the shadows as if it were dark clothing.
Despite being a relatively light robe, it provides great defense and additional resistance to acid damage.
Only Fall can wear it.

Kakuto has great resistance to physical attacks, absorbing a considerable amount of damage from slashing, piercing, or blunt weapons.

This mysterious scimitar is made entirely of sapphire. The cold it emits is almost unbearable, leading you to conclude that it hails from another plane, most likely an inhospitable and harsh place like the home of Cryonax. Upon destroying the ice golem, Icelock, this sword emerged from within him. Despite not having a steel blade, the sapphire is so sharp that it can cut through even the heaviest metal.
For some strange reason, whoever wields this sword will do so as if they were a formidable warrior. Almost as if the sword is controlling the warrior, not the other way around.

If you are reading this, it means I am dead, so it no longer matters that my truth is revealed. These words are for whoever is reading, though I hope that is you, Gemystara. I have loved you in silence, in whispers carried by the wind, while the echo of my words is now lost in the Abyss. I have loved you in the shadows of countless eternal nights, and I love you now in the twilight of my final breaths.
However, I know that your heart will never hear the echoes of my immortal love. No, because I know you love another, even though he is already dead.
Gerwulf, that name I have cursed in the darkness more times than I can remember. A mere human. I could have rejoiced in his brave fall, but no, Gemystara. I cannot, because I know that his fall has also meant yours.
Imnescar fell for reasons I do not fully understand, but finally, thanks to your little Caraneth and her friend, <CHARNAME>, I have discovered what you have also uncovered.
"The Legion that cannot be seen" or, in the words of their own terrible language, Morgrath, has been responsible for everything. I have glimpsed its power. Its horrible power. Beneath its ineffable sinister cloak lies the Shyntquarra. There is no exact translation of the meaning of such a terrible occurrence, but what I have been able to piece together is as follows. The Shyntquarra is "the buzzing of ocean waves mixed with the violence of an angry swarm of wasps." Such is the force that fell upon Imnescar and wiped out all life there. The few survivors have been fortunate. Or cursed.
Morgrath did not achieve his purpose of invading this plane with his demonic forces because he left his primary target alive. And that is you, Gemystara.
When I realized this, if there was any glimmer of hope, it was lost because I discovered that you had gone there, Gemystara. You had gone into the very shadows of that webbed layer in the Abyss. The so-called Rachnidra: the Pits of the Demonic Web.
I have known you for centuries, and I know you would not have gone unless you had an infallible plan to face Morgrath. I also know you well enough to understand that this plan will likely cost your life, a willingness to sacrifice yourself for those you love. Then I understood why you left without saying a word to your little Caraneth.
My dealings with Icelock, Cryonax's minion, have prevented me from going in search of you. The Prince of the Cruel Glacier knows that Morgrath is trying to take control of the Material Plane. My life is in danger because I have promised your daughter to find out your whereabouts. But this will lead to a war against the Elemental Plane of Ice. Such an event would mean the death of hundreds of thousands here in Amn alone. If only I could get rid of Icelock. Perhaps I could use this power in the form of an icy rose to open a portal here and go to Rachnidra.
I only pray to Mystra that it is not too late.

@200153  = ~Primitive caves gradually evolve into an ancient civilization. Powerful columns of black rock and cyclopean clouds of emerald arcane fire. It is strange how they achieve those prismatic colors in the fiery force, as their hues vary from amethyst to sapphire. The buildings have been affected by the great war against the Spiders, and their influence has slowly seeped into the reptilian lands. From what we have observed, Morgrath's forces have not been able to penetrate the amethyst portal area, but we have. We have managed to arrive at the swamp of Rask'tar Krathiss, the champion of Dreach-naga. There, where the vegetation twists in an eternal embrace with the muddy earth, the swamps rise in a symphony of darkness and decay. The mist drapes like a funereal cloak over the rotting vegetation, hiding the unfathomable secrets that lie among the twisted vines.~

@200161  = ~Dreach-naga, The Reptilian Realm - Volume II~
@200154  = ~Dreach-naga is a barren passage where beings dwell whose existence can only be glimpsed in the deepest dreams of madness. Humanoid creatures, deformed by the influence of arcane forces emanating from the depths of the earth. Their bodies are a grotesque amalgamation of scaled skin, reminiscent of ancient reptiles, and elongated limbs that twist like serpents in a macabre dance.
No one knows for certain what dark plans these creatures are scheming in the remote confines of the haunted swamps. Vidomina theorizes that they seek to reach the Prime Plane, or at least that is the Medusa Queen's design.~

@200162  = ~Dreach-naga, The Reptilian Realm - Volume III~

Over the years, we have only observed how the Reptiles have been weakening against the arachnid forces and have lost ground despite their arcane efforts.
I have urged Vidomina to join forces with these creatures since Morgrath does not need allies. In response, I have received a negative answer. Vidomina believes that Tisiphone, in her growing madness, would only destroy us at the slightest opportunity.
I can only hope for the arrival of something or someone to end this damned war so that we can return to our plane, the Material Plane.~

We have come to the conclusion that these creatures are not servants of Lolth, but rather of a lesser demonic entity. It has taken a great deal of our power to find out the name of such a terrible being: Morgrath. The intelligence of their arachnid creatures is supreme, surpassing any enemy we have faced. The war they have waged against Tisiphone's Reptiles is worthy of being written in military strategy books or in tales of horror. The reptiles are not creatures of my devotion, but they seem to at least have a system that resembles our old life in Amn. They cultivate their own food and tend strange insects that serve as livestock. Our covert operations have led us to these conclusions, and I continue to insist that an alliance with these creatures could benefit us in escaping this place. Why do I prefer reptiles over spiders? As I said, the reptiles cultivate and tend carefully. The spiders... devour everything in their path, leaving a wasteland of destruction, death, and sorrow.~

It is not a frequent occurrence, but I am convinced that this phase spider is responsible. Its size is enormous, and it has a large eye on its abdomen. I was fortunate to escape its presence as it is capable of detecting invisible presences. I could only escape when I summoned some creatures from the Astral Plane. They lasted only a few seconds.
The horror here is omnipresent, and death is the only fate that awaits those who dare to challenge its monstrous inhabitants.~

@200165  = ~Rachnidra, The Spider Realm - Volume III~
@200158  = ~The silence lately is unsettling. It has been some time since any arachnid has been observed in the area. Even the Reptiles, led by General Cho'Nuja, have begun to reclaim lands lost to Mesothel, the phase spider with the cyclopean eye. I don't think it will be long before they reach the Enclave area, although I trust that diplomacy with the General may give us some time to escape this horrendous plane. Perhaps even their shamans will offer us aid, although, certainly, I do not trust their Queen, the Medusa. Her thirst for violence is only comparable to that of a Tanar'ri from the Nine Hells. Once again, my recommendations were ignored. Vidomina believes we should wait, as she doubts that Morgrath has given up on his plan to conquer Dreach-naga.~

@200152  = ~"We appeared in these strange caves after fleeing from that terrible giant-eyed monster. It is hard to remember in the darkness, but surely, without fear of making a mistake, it was a gigantic spider. Around me is a great variety of livestock. Cows, chickens, goats, horses. All harmless animals with deep terror reflected in their eyes. I think I did not escape from that monster, but rather was captured by it. Right now I hear footsteps in the distance. They multiply. They grow louder. I have managed to find refuge in a dark nook, but I fear that my respite will betray me. The footsteps grow louder. They are here. They are arachnids. Gigantic. Too many to count. They have arrived. They pounce on the animals... the slaughter... is indescribable."

There seems to be a somewhat clumsy drawing. You are convinced it is a self-portrait of the lizardman. Below the text continues.

"Yes, Qyl'tar looks like this. So beautiful. Now I must stop writing. Just when I was starting to like this practice. Cho'Nuja says that he will continue to teach primary writing classes later. Now I must continue working to demolish the Spider Queen's statue. I can't believe that the spiders built that in our lands. The sooner we destroy it, the better.

We have been fleeing from the spiders for three days. Phillipe writes when nervous but Neville is annoyed. Eugene fortunately thinks it is a good idea because Phillipe's words could help the band. Right now we are hiding in the shadows while a yellow-furred spider patrols the halls.

Day 6

Eugene has not returned from searching for food. Phillipe is scared. Neville is also scared although he won't admit it to Phillipe. Finally, we agreed to go together to search for Eugene. I hope Eugene is well.

Day 9

My brothers, my friends are dead. Skel'Tharant. Skel'Tharant. That name. That shadow. That monster. Phillipe cannot.

Day 11

Phillipe is calmer now. Cried all the time during the last two days. Now clearing up in the diary what has happened. Phillipe and Neville went looking for Eugene but were captured by multicolored giant spiders. They did not kill us but took us to the blue caves. We went through dark paths until we reached a giant cave. Stakes coming out of the floor and it was full of bones like in the spider caves, but this one was different. The bones seemed to belong to humans, not animals. We found Eugene tied to a web and giant spiders throwing themselves at him. Eugene, Neville, and Phillipe together again, but Phillipe didn't suspect it would be the last time they were together.
Phillipe managed to pull out the spider's claws and cut the web. Freeing friends but when we tried to escape, the exit was blocked by a large boulder. But it wasn't a boulder. No. It was a shadow that we could see with the torchlight from the bridge. A giant spider, much larger than the others.
Its legs were like large sharp swords and its fangs were sharp like axes. Its eyes were red as blood. The spider emitted a voice. We realized the spider was laughing.
"Where are you going?" it asked or something like that. Saying things like "the rats are disgusting and if I haven't devoured them it's because they taste horrible. I, Skel'Tharant, prefer human flesh. But I kill rats for fun."
Eugene threw himself at the monster so that Phillipe and Neville could escape. But Neville helped by attacking Skel'Tharant from behind. Phillipe watched as friends died in seconds. Phillipe fled in terror. Phillipe hid in the shadows while friends were being torn apart. Phillipe fled. Phillipe fled.

Day 30

Phillipe spies on a strange ancient stone structure. Sees undead coming and going. Phillipe thinks the undead are not hostile, but Phillipe is afraid of the bone sorceress. Better to stay hidden in the lizard land. Lizards don't pay any attention to Phillipe. Lizards are immersed in war against the spiders.

Day 40

Phillipe went to the swamp in search of food. But to get to the swamp, he had to cross a spooky portal of purple lightning. Phillipe was stunned by such a sight, but it didn't stop Phillipe from crossing the portal. The swamp is filled with delicious mosses and mushrooms. But Phillipe fled quickly as it was full of snakes. But worse, that giant multi-headed creature is terrifying. Saw it launch a liquid that consumes its victims. The swamp is a very dangerous place.

Day ??

Phillipe has lost track of the days. Phillipe is alone. Phillipe misses his brothers. Misses the sunlight and moonlight. The wind. The old burrow. Phillipe misses his brothers.~

Or train my troops in the Swamps of Rask'tar Krathiss. Anyway, I think it's a good opportunity to annoy that thick-headed Qyl'tar. He may have more brute strength, but my mind is sharper. He's jealous that I can write better than him. So much so that he's now dabbling in drawing. I've seen him draw a self-portrait. I managed to hold back laughter for many minutes, which has been quite a feat. What should I do now? Put my creativity into practice, yes. I'm going to draw him."

At the end of the notes, you can see a drawing of a large lizard warrior wielding a trident. The resemblance to the real Qyl'tar is striking. Next to the drawing is the artist's signature: Vreshnak.~

Kazsteel, fascinated, bought the sword at an exorbitant price and began to carry it everywhere. Soon he discovered that the sword had no magical enchantments, only ornamental gemstones. Kazsteel spent much of his wealth trying to enchant the wakizashi, but it seemed resistant to enchantments and even to forge hammers trying to destroy it. A shrewd merchant realized that the enchantment came from the sword's hilt, so he offered Kazsteel a true magical item in exchange for the sword's hilt. Kazsteel agreed, and the merchant only had to remove the hilt (or rather, the ornamental gem from it) and enchant a simple ring with its components.

Blinding was frequently used by the thugs working for this mage. Despite Retland's great education, he was more of a blackmailing thug than a noble leader.

His gang, the Freeloader Boys, intimidated and oppressed several Westgate residents for a decade until a mage in the service of Tyr, Alistar Lavell, gathered his allies to confront Retland's henchmen.

When Alistar defeated Retland and his gang, he returned Blinding to the church of Tyr, where it was given to a traveling priest.

One such criminal, a thug named Hellpin, was offended by the beating he received. Hellpin unleashed his dogs on Tad the Virtuous one foggy night. Tad managed to kill more than half of the canines before being defeated.

The Astrum passed through the hands of numerous heroes and villains over the centuries, each seeking to harness its celestial power for their own ends.

She was traveling with Ilmaterine pilgrims when they were attacked by a group of bandits. The bandits killed and severely wounded most of the pilgrims and cut the strings of Sefica's harp when she tried to aid the injured travelers.

After the bandits left, Sefica prayed to Ilmater for help in her time of need. As she plucked the strings of the harp with her eyes closed in prayer, miraculous music flowed from it, healing anyone who heard it. The next day, the bandits returned and killed Sefica for healing the pilgrims.

@200287  = ~Celestial Wrath~
@200288  = ~Many years ago, fierce storms and lightning-induced fires ravaged the province ruled by Daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisors, all respected wizards, soon deduced that nature was not at fault, but a powerful dragon of unknown order. Some of the advisors suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed it was born from the Primordial Chaos before Kara-Tur was constructed. But they all agreed to call it Celestial Fury.

Despite this, Daimyo Hoshi did not want the dragon to ravage the village, so he decided to end it. He commissioned the renowned Chigatta (a solitary artisan, master of mystical arts) to forge a weapon that could both cleave the dragon's soul and pierce its scaly body. Chigatta's work resulted in the highest quality katana imaginable, named Celestial Fury after the beast it was destined to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought to lift the curse from his province among the storm clouds. Screams and roars echoed through the skies for days, and forked flames illuminated the nights. In the end, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within the sword, merging the two celestial furies and marking Order over Chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi commissioned Chigatta to make a sheath from the dragon's skin and embed its magical pearl into the hilt.

Despite this, the dragon got its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. The spirit of Celestial Fury took control of Hoshi, forcing him to kill Chigatta and then himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely discarded by Hoshi's grieving family) and may have passed through many hands in the years since.

Celestial Fury is a katana of excellent construction; a flexible yet indestructible blade with an excellent edge and a hilt wrapped in comfortable leather with a massive pearl fixed at its end. The magical runes of Celestial Fury are inscribed on the blade, which glows with a pale violet and crackles with electricity when wielded. The sword comes with a dragon-skin sheath, whose bizarre scales constantly shimmer with silver, blue, and violet flashes.

Celestial Fury has been upgraded to Celestial Wrath due to imbution with the heart of Skel'Tharant, the bebilith champion of Rachnidra, making the katana a +5 weapon. It also adds Poison Strike to its combat abilities and grants immunity to poison.

It was not necessary until the spiders arrived. Initially, chaos took over our hearts and we would have been quickly defeated if it weren't for the strength of our General. Our Queen did well in placing him at the top of our command chain. Immediately, a defense plan was initiated, and in our spare time, we used the scrolls and books belonging to the curious adventurers who came to our Abyss. We practiced drawing the letters of this language in the earth, and only when we were quite advanced were we allowed to have this strange material called paper. We read books and learned a lot about other races. This knowledge has given us exceptional discipline and has served us in times of war. Cho says I am the most advanced student in the company. Coming from a lizard-man, this is quite a statement, as they were not always at peace with us, the yuan-ti. The times when we fought among ourselves are behind us: having a common enemy has united us although it has not given us any advantage. The spiders have advanced too much and I think our race is on the brink of extinction. At least we will not go hating each other. We will die together, as brothers."

@200332  = ~WILDGUARD: Wildguards are from the reptilian realm of Dreach-naga. They are warriors focused on melee combat due to their predatory nature, but are firmly shaped to serve as elite warriors in the Queen's personal ranks. Because of this, they are unable to wield weapons or use ranged attacks, limiting their attacks to the claws and blades they possess innately.~

@200333  = ~Shehad Ibahalii~
@200334  = ~Shehad Ibahalii: Royal Glory

This technique will always be part of Cho'Nuja's combat styles. It consists of a powerful strike with his blades, inflicting slashing damage to the victims. By default, the technique involves the lizardfolk's concentration to regenerate wounds during combat. It is the General's oldest and one of his most well-known techniques, so it will always be used in combination with another technique deemed appropriate. The attack range will adapt depending on the combination with the chosen attack. For example: If Malakta Wiivai, which has a long-range (similar to a greatsword), is used, then Shehad Ibahalii will have a long-range attack. However, this will not be the case if Uvelucal Jeskic, which has a short-range attack, is used.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Reptilian Regeneration: Cho'Nuja will regenerate 1 hit point every 10 seconds.

- Damage: 1D6 +5
- THAC0: +5
- Base Damage Type: Slashing

@200335  = ~Malakta Wiivai~
@200336  = ~Malakta Wiivai: Eternal Fury

Malakta Wiivai focuses on a rapid combination of piercing and slashing attacks. Cho'Nuja has undergone rigorous training in the swamps of Dreach-naga, facing his opponents with a ferocious Fury, perfecting the use of his claws and applying them to his enemies' flesh like a whirlwind of rage and carnage. The bloodlust allows the General to accelerate his movements and attacks for a few seconds.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Enhanced Acceleration: Each attack has a 20% chance to Accelerate the Wildguard for 6 seconds.

- Damage: 1D4 +5, +1 points of slashing damage
- THAC0: +5
- Base Damage Type: Piercing

- Attack Range: 2

@200337  = ~Shehadtok Skriiod~
@200338  = ~Shehadtok Skriiod: Imperial Wrath

Cho'Nuja's extensive studies against various opponents have forced him to expand his combat techniques as some opponents are immune to slashing and piercing attacks. Shehadtok Skriiod allows the use of his powerful fists combined with the claws embedded in his forearms. While the blunt damage is half of what he inflicts with his other techniques, Cho has learned that certain strikes to specific points on the enemy's body will stun them, incapacitating them for a few seconds.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Paralysis: Each attack has a 15% chance to Stun the opponent for 6 seconds.

- Damage: 1D2 +5, +1 points of slashing damage

@200339  = ~Uvelucal Jeskic~
@200340  = ~Uvelucal Jeskic: Acid Fangs

Some reptiles have the ability to absorb life from their victims. Such is the case with Jon's lineage, from which Cho'Nuja comes (the General's full name is Jon Cho'Nuja). Cho has perfected this technique, which, while not inflicting as much damage as his other attacks, has the potential to heal his wounds by absorbing the opponent's energy, in addition to causing dangerous acid damage with each successful hit.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Healing: Each attack has a 15% chance to heal Cho for 25 hit points.

- Damage: 1D2 +5
- Acid Damage: 1D3

- Base Damage Type: Piercing
- Speed Factor: 1
- Attack Range: 1
- Martial Talent: Spear~

@200341  = ~Cayosini Di Thirhe~
@200342  = ~Cayosini Di Thirhe: Vengeance Blades

The learning from the Dreach-naga Shield has allowed the General to master the Cayosini Di Thirhe technique. It consists of delivering a piercing attack and inflicting cold damage, while slowing the victim's movements. Cho would sacrifice some physical damage in these attacks but adds elemental cold damage to each of his successful attacks.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Slowing: Each attack has a 10% chance to slow the opponent for 20 seconds.

- Damage: 1D3 +5, +1 point of piercing damage
- Cold Damage: 1D2

- Speed Factor: 2
- Attack Range: 2
- Martial Talent: Scimitar/wakizashi/ninja-to~

@200343  = ~Elite Lizardfolk Scales~
@200344  = ~The tough scales of Cho provide more than enough physical defense for melee combat. For years, Cho'Nuja has trained in the ranks of the Dreach-naga reptilian armies, fighting for decades against abyssal and demonic foes, rising to the rank of General. He is a battle-hardened veteran, and his scaled skin shows it. Due to his race, the scales protect against most existing acids.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Armor Class: 2 (0 against blunt damage, 1 against piercing and projectile damage)
Special Abilities: +90% resistance to acid
Weight: 0~

@200345  = ~Draconic Claws~
@200346  = ~The lizardfolk's limbs are prepared to advance tirelessly in complex terrains. For General Jon Cho'Nuja, his limbs have been strengthened throughout his life as an elite soldier in the Swamps of Rask'tar Krathiss. While Cho cannot use boots, he has trained his natural limbs, which can activate a draconic acceleration with exceptional duration. Innately, the lizardfolk will have a bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Draconic Celerity: Once per day, Cho'Nuja can activate his draconic acceleration, which has a lengthy duration of 8 hours. It can be dispelled.

Armor Class against projectile attacks: +5

@200347  = ~Jon Clan~
@200348  = ~Cho'Nuja hails from the draconian Jon clan of Dreach-naga, a powerful tribe of lizardfolk with a strong natural resistance to acid. As an elite warrior, Cho has specialized his physical training to an extreme and dangerous level. He is capable of absorbing physical damage, especially slashing damage. However, the Jon clan has always been weak against fire, one of the main reasons Cho has respected the hydra Rask'tar Krathiss, who had powerful fire attacks.

CHARACTERISTICS:

Special Abilities:

- Draconic Celerity: Once per day, Cho'Nuja can activate his draconic acceleration, which lasts for an extended 8 hours. It can be dispelled.

@200351  = ~Frostmaster~
@200352  = ~frostmaster~ // Para-Elemental Plane of Ice
@200353  = ~FROSTMASTER: Selu'taar elves can specialize in different branches of magic. However, those who dare to forge a true connection with Frostfell, the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice, face the great danger of having their lives consumed by the relentless cold of Cryonax, the Prince of evil creatures that wield cold. Those who pass the trials gain terrible power in casting ice spells, being able to summon creatures from the Plane of Ice as allies and cast powerful protections against this element.

The handle bears some archaic insignias of the Dwarven language and is so ineffable that it causes pain to the eyes. However, the inscription of Bloodaxe stands out, giving the impression that only someone with such a surname is capable of wielding it.

It radiates a terrible power, electrocuting anyone who is not of Aldant blood. Additionally, there is a divine aura that contrasts with the danger of the blade. The sword provides protection against level drain, typically caused by undead creatures. Moreover, each hit has a chance to banish undead from this plane. Undoubtedly, the ritual used in the reinforcing process has awakened an instinctive hatred in the weapon, probably stemming from the blood of Dusk himself.

@400019  = ~These lightweight braces provide invaluable defense to the wearer, including (through the magical power with which they were imbued) the ability to conjure a defensive expansion that emanates from their center and expands to the entire body, providing the wearer with a hardness comparable to that of rock.

Amidst the destruction, an unnamed, solitary and somber elf prayed to the Druid God, Mielikki, for the strength to fight against the invaders. In that instant, his bare torso was covered with a mysterious tough leather hide.
The elf's burning desire to protect his land granted him the ability to defend himself against fire, gaining a powerful fiery attack and protection against the element.

The steps in its creation, a long and secret process, are more of an art form than anything else. Its blade is one of the most important facets of Kara-Tur culture. Touching or handling the katana of a samurai is an insult that will bring their wrath. For a gaijin or foreigner to possess one of these swords is rare. Either the gaijin has been honored by an important minister or has killed a samurai.

In the midst of battle, his body took on a golden color and his limbs moved so quickly that it was difficult for the opponent to guess where he would strike. Over the years, Soujiro abandoned the path of assassination and became a nomad. He was never heard from again, and his katana was sold at an excellent price, its fate as uncertain as its original owner.

The wakizashi is of equal quality to the katana, although it is shorter, measuring between 30 and 60 centimeters, making it a dangerous weapon in expert hands.

It's impossible to ignore the craftsmanship that went into building this katana. The most striking feature is the fiery edge, which inflicts deadly damage on the victim. The second is the oil with which it is constantly bathed, reportedly made from the flesh of countless victims who were slashed with Mugenjin. It is said to have once dueled its opposing blade: Shin-Ushi, The Heart of the Sword. You are unaware of the reason why the sword was imbued this way, because no matter how hard you try, you cannot quell the fire of its steel. On the blade lies an inscription: "The Fiery Wrath."

Royal Avenger: Finally, the weapon that completes the Wizard Slayer's set is a divinely imbued Staff-Spear infused with Tempus' divine power and the warrior Nathan Benork's thirst for vengeance.
Tempus' divine power increases the wielder's strength immensely, making him a deadly warrior.
The abjurations imbued by cleric Aznagarb made the weapon capable of dispelling the victim's magical protections, thus facilitating the warrior's combat.
And Benork's fury allowed him to poison the weapon with a corrosive hatred, which would infect anyone who had the misfortune of being struck by it.

Finally, after being fully armed with his Wizard Slayer Set, Duke Nathan Benork headed his destiny towards the fight against the necromancers, where no one else heard from him. Some say he managed to defeat the necromancers, giving them an unexpected and painful death. However, the leader of the Order, Socram, managed to bring him down through (ironically) a poisoned dagger that lodged in the Warrior's heart.
Nathan Benork died agonizing, but with a smile on his face. His revenge would have been completed when the Avenger's poison invaded the soul of his mortal enemy, Socram.
The Wizard Slayer artifacts scattered throughout Amn.

// Bellfame's Ring

@400273 = ~Forest Ring of Mir~
@400275 = ~Forest Ring of Mir

Several centuries ago, in the depths of the Mir forest, the nymph Bellfame lived with her beasts. For many years, she protected the Tethyr forest from poachers and power-hungry humans. Many creatures served as her allies, and nature was grateful to her.
It was during the Year of the Tankard that she would meet her fateful end: Bellfame was unaware of the war brewing between Tethyr and the Dark Tyrant of Mintar, Teldorn Darkhope. The evil cleric planned to invade the lands of Tethyr, hiding his Zentharim army in the depths of the forest. One of his generals, the Knight Imperceptor (a title that describes the desire for others to suffer) named Kartlzer, noticed that the Forest of Mir presented an opportunity to acquire power, in addition to being a hiding place, as his wizards identified the presence of a mysterious nymph at the heart of a swamp.
Kartlzer was aware of the arcane advantages that could be obtained from a nymph, whether alive or dead, so he decided to hunt her, bringing along his personal sorcerer and his twenty best soldiers.

Bellfame, who had an innate connection with the very roots of the forest, was warned of the danger that loomed over her and the grove if the Dark Tyrant's men remained in Mir. So, she decided to prepare for the imminent combat, using her best animals.
Baba, the Nervous Mouse, was the one who informed the nymph of the enemy's approach. Then, Bellfame conjured a cloud of confusion over the humans, which allowed her agile wolves to attack:
Sayang, the Worg Wolf, attacked the first row, while Jack, the Winter Wolf, used his icy breath against the rear.
Disconcerted, the men attempted to counterattack. The archers were the first to react. They tensed their arrows and aimed at Jack and Sayang. But it was at that moment that, from the earth and darkness, Uma, the Shadow Wolf, emerged and attacked and immobilized the archers.
Flooded with fury, Kartlzer and his mage attacked Bellfame, for they knew that if she fell, her beasts would be disoriented.
To Bellfame's misfortune, Kartlzer's mage was very skilled in the vocalization of spells, but he did not count on the interruption of his spell by a small mouse that strangely had the power to deafen his opponents with an infernal squeal. The mage had not realized that the mouse had climbed onto his tunic. When he was about to get rid of Baba, Bellfame had finished her conjuration and managed to paralyze the mage.
But this had left her exposed to Kartlzer's imminent attack: the Knight attacked her holding his sword. Just before the final impact, Kartlzer's hand was devoured by Bellfame's last beast: Thiago, the brown bear.
Although, at first, victory seemed to be on the nymph's side, the humans were quickly incorporating and counterattacking the beasts, which had no choice but to regroup with their summoner.
Kartlzer's mage, who had cast a protection against the Knight, was now preparing a terrible Death Spell against Bellfame.
The nymph, for her part, managed to identify the necromancer's spell, so she began a counter-conjuration. But this would cost her all her strength, so she also resorted to a last desperate plan.

The wizard finished his spell and cast it at Bellfame and her animals. To his misfortune and horror, he could also identify that the nymph uttered a Word of Power. It was "Fear". At that moment, all the humans were infected with a contagious terror in their hearts, and fled in panic, lost forever in the leafy depths of the forest.

Bellfame, along with her beasts, had disappeared. The nymph used a magical ring that Baba had stolen from the wizard while it was in his tunic and used that artifact as protection against the Death Spell. Although it was enough to prevent the spell from annihilating them instantly, the ring not only absorbed the spell but also absorbed the nymph and her animals.

They were transported to the astral plane of summonings, where creatures are immortal and serve those who summon them. Bellfame can return to the Material Plane whenever she is required, and she can bring her beasts with her as well.

However, Bellfame's will is such that only those of good heart can call her to battle.

@400308 = ~Leprechaun Recipe Book

Greetings, travelers. I leave you this book with the necessary recipes to forge powerful artifacts, from the hand of the good Michelson. I think everything is quite clear, so I hope that when you gather what is needed for an artifact, you come to us (talk to me first, Michelson is always lost in his leprechaun things).
Here we go:

Cormyrean Sword of Disruption

Dusk, if you're reading this, this formula should interest you. Michelson has noticed something peculiar about your Cormyrean sword: it has been repaired by elven artisans from Shilmista. Surely, it is the sword that was broken when you arrived at the Forest of Shadows. While the sword itself is quite powerful, Michelson believes that with certain ingredients, you can greatly enhance it:

You'll need:
- Dusk's sword (obviously)
- Scroll of protection from undead (usually sold in some churches)
- Moonbar gem (a fairly common gem)
- Turquoise gem (a fairly common gem)
- King's Tears (a valuable, rare gem)
- The Book of Kaza (definitely the most difficult ingredient to obtain)
- Gold: 7500 pieces

Cormyr Defense

Dusk, this is another note for you. Michelson says he can enhance your Shilmist armor by adding some plates for defensive improvement. But he demands something... particular. He says he needs a plate of Cormyrean origin, such as a piece of shield, for example. It must be from the Purple Dragon Order. The little guy analyzed your equipment, Dusk, and nothing you currently have will do. So we would need:

- Dusk's armor (for obvious reasons)
- Cormyrean metal (could be a piece of shield, for example)
- Horn Coral Gem (a black gem, quite common)
- Black Opal (a common gem, but somewhat valuable)
- Gold: 7500

Stone Defense Bracers

The name itself indicates its function, don't you think?

You'll need:
- Bracers of Defense A.C. 8 (magical bracers, you may find some in the Adventurer Mart)
- Scroll of Protection from Petrification (can be found in some churches. NOTE: Do not confuse with the magical scroll!)
- Jasper Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Gold: 3000 pieces
	
Crimson Thunder

Michelson claims he's able to replicate an ancient artifact, something he saw in another plane. I don't quite understand what he means, but it seems he's quite demanding with the ingredients. I think it might be worth trying to obtain them.

You'll need:
- +2 Warhammer: Ashideena (The warhammer is golden and deals electrical damage)
- Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2 (An item that's somewhat strange, but I don't think it's impossible to obtain)
- Lightning Bolt Scroll (you might find one in a magical scroll shop)
- Wand of Paralyzation (an unusual item, but I don't think it's impossible to obtain)
- Bloodstone Amulet (a necklace with red gems, quite common)
- Ruby Ring (a scarlet ring, expensive, but relatively common)
- Gold: 25000

Wildfire
The leprechaun claims and assures that shapeshifting druids can wear armor, even when they turn into lycanthropes. I'm not sure if that's true, so the little one told me he'll replicate a powerful leather armor that only Shapeshifters can wear.

Needed:
- Karajah's Leather Armor (a rare item, but I've heard Ribald has it in his inventory)
- Fire Agate Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Scroll of Protection from Fire (usually sold in some churches)
- Necklace of Form Stability (possibly the strangest artifact, but if Michelson demands it, it's because it can be obtained)
- Gold: 7000

Venom Strike

I'm not sure what this artifact is, but I assume it must be something like a mace or a club, maybe even a flail. Based on its ingredients, the result should be very satisfying.

You will need:

- Wyvern's Tail (Michelson says it's a mace made from a wyvern's tail. Extremely poisonous)
- Scroll of Protection from Poison (usually sold in some churches)
- Scroll of Vampiric Touch (a magical scroll, which may be sold in some shops)
- Potion of Regeneration (a fairly common potion, at least for adventurers)
- Star Diopside Gem (a relatively common gem, although not easy to obtain)
- Sphene Gem (same as above)
- Gold: 25000

Larloch's Fang

Michelson says he can create an axe that performs the same functions as the Fang of Lich Larloch. I didn't want to ask more, but I assume it's worth trying to get these ingredients.

You will need:

- Battle Axe +1 (a fairly common magical axe if you ask me)
- Potion of Cold Resistance (a potion that can be obtained at some adventurer shops)
- Iol Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Larloch's Minor Drain Scroll (a magical scroll, which may be sold in some shops)
- Helm of Charm Protection  (a protective helmet, I think Michelson wants to extract part of its magic to embed it in the axe)
- Gold: 12500

Hellfrost

Apparently, Michelson has been to an infernal plane where fire does not exist. He says he learned how to forge a powerful weapon there, specifically a bastard sword. To replicate it, he needs:

- Bastard Sword +2 (you may be able to find it in some shop)
- Scroll of Protection from Cold (usually sold in some churches)
- Lynx Eye Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Aquamarine Gem (a particular gem, but you should have no trouble finding one on your travels)
- Diamond (a valuable gem, but it's worth investing in this)
- Gold: 12500
	




SECRET NOTE:
When Michelson met Dusk, he became somewhat obsessed with him. Apparently, Wizard Assassins generate a deep respect in him, perhaps because he fears them since (as you will suppose) Michelson is a magical being. I discovered that he has a legendary artifact in his possession, called The Royal Avenger. It is the original weapon that Count Benork wielded when he fought against a Necromancer order in the North. How did it come into his possession? No idea... but the point of this is to tell you that if you find the rest of Benork's Assassin Set, he may give you his ultimate weapon. I'll tell you the necessary artifacts, although all I know about them are their names:

- Calia's Heartbeat
- Breath of Lineage
- Iris of Tempus
- Benork's Fortitude
- Protection of Aznagarb
- Path of the Ancestors
- Aznagarb's Defense
- Benork's Hope

PS: If you get all eight artifacts, bring Dusk with you. Something tells me that Michelson will only give you the weapon if he is present. And make sure he has his Cormyrean staff. I don't think the little one will want to give away such a powerful weapon for nothing.

Sincerely,
Mathyus Davis.-~

@400314 = ~Reforged Cormyrean sword

This bastard sword was originally forged in Cormyr. A typical soldier's sword. However, its craftsmanship is exquisite, with its edge being dangerous to anything it touches.
According to Dusk, it was broken in a battle against a giant troll. Later, it was reforged by the Elbereth king's elven artisans, enhancing its enchantments and adding acid damage to it, so as not to suffer the same consequences when facing those creatures of the mountains.

// ESPADA CARMESÍ
@400334 = ~Crimson sword~
@400335 = ~Crimson sword

The weapon was created from an evil orb. Dusk has managed to unleash its full power, although at a cost we cannot comprehend. The sword glows with a crimson color, blood red, just like the mysterious orb. Despite being the size of a regular bastard sword, its weight is enormous compared to a regular one. As expected, only Dusk can wield it.

The weapon was created from a malevolent orb. Dusk has decided to seek out the Shilmist explorer Mathyus Davis to eradicate the evil within it, along with the mysterious leprechaun Michelson. While the orb's power diminished after its purification, Dusk managed to unleash its inner power, resulting in the creation of this sword. As expected, only he can wield it.

// BELLFAME RING MEJORADO
@400390 = ~Forest Ring of Mir

Several centuries ago, in the depths of the Mir forest, the nymph Bellfame lived with her beasts. For many years, she protected the Tethyr forest from poachers and power-hungry humans. Many creatures served as her allies, and nature was grateful to her.
It was during the Year of the Tankard that she would meet her fateful end: Bellfame was unaware of the war brewing between Tethyr and the Dark Tyrant of Mintar, Teldorn Darkhope. The evil cleric planned to invade the lands of Tethyr, hiding his Zentharim army in the depths of the forest. One of his generals, the Knight Imperceptor (a title that describes the desire for others to suffer) named Kartlzer, noticed that the Forest of Mir presented an opportunity to acquire power, in addition to being a hiding place, as his wizards identified the presence of a mysterious nymph at the heart of a swamp.
Kartlzer was aware of the arcane advantages that could be obtained from a nymph, whether alive or dead, so he decided to hunt her, bringing along his personal sorcerer and his twenty best soldiers.

Bellfame, who had an innate connection with the very roots of the forest, was warned of the danger that loomed over her and the grove if the Dark Tyrant's men remained in Mir. So, she decided to prepare for the imminent combat, using her best animals.
Baba, the Nervous Mouse, was the one who informed the nymph of the enemy's approach. Then, Bellfame conjured a cloud of confusion over the humans, which allowed her agile wolves to attack:
Sayang, the Worg Wolf, attacked the first row, while Jack, the Winter Wolf, used his icy breath against the rear.
Disconcerted, the men attempted to counterattack. The archers were the first to react. They tensed their arrows and aimed at Jack and Sayang. But it was at that moment that, from the earth and darkness, Uma, the Shadow Wolf, emerged and attacked and immobilized the archers.
Flooded with fury, Kartlzer and his mage attacked Bellfame, for they knew that if she fell, her beasts would be disoriented.
To Bellfame's misfortune, Kartlzer's mage was very skilled in the vocalization of spells, but he did not count on the interruption of his spell by a small mouse that strangely had the power to deafen his opponents with an infernal squeal. The mage had not realized that the mouse had climbed onto his tunic. When he was about to get rid of Baba, Bellfame had finished her conjuration and managed to paralyze the mage.
But this had left her exposed to Kartlzer's imminent attack: the Knight attacked her holding his sword. Just before the final impact, Kartlzer's hand was devoured by Bellfame's last beast: Thiago, the brown bear.
Although, at first, victory seemed to be on the nymph's side, the humans were quickly incorporating and counterattacking the beasts, which had no choice but to regroup with their summoner.
Kartlzer's mage, who had cast a protection against the Knight, was now preparing a terrible Death Spell against Bellfame.
The nymph, for her part, managed to identify the necromancer's spell, so she began a counter-conjuration. But this would cost her all her strength, so she also resorted to a last desperate plan.

The wizard finished his spell and cast it at Bellfame and her animals. To his misfortune and horror, he could also identify that the nymph uttered a Word of Power. It was "Fear". At that moment, all the humans were infected with a contagious terror in their hearts, and fled in panic, lost forever in the leafy depths of the forest.

Bellfame, along with her beasts, had disappeared. The nymph used a magical ring that Baba had stolen from the wizard while it was in his tunic and used that artifact as protection against the Death Spell. Although it was enough to prevent the spell from annihilating them instantly, the ring not only absorbed the spell but also absorbed the nymph and her animals.

They were transported to the astral plane of summonings, where creatures are immortal and serve those who summon them. Bellfame can return to the Material Plane whenever she is required, and she can bring her beasts with her as well.

However, Bellfame's will is such that only those of good heart can call her to battle.

The ring has been improved by Bellfame herself so that Dusk can use it. She also reinforced it to provide the bearer with improved magical resistance.

Benork was a forgotten duke from the North who fought to avenge his family's death. Legend has it that a dark broterhood of ominous sorcerers coveted his castle for unknown reasons, although rumors mention that they wanted to join Larloch's clan, the Lich King, and as part of their initiation rite, they needed royal blood.
The necromancers employed their arcane arts to cruelly liquidate the noble's family. Only Duke Benork survived by resisting a powerful spell of derangement. Despite this, he was left blind.
His best friend was a powerful cleric of Tempus, who came to his rescue. Both fled from the terrible necromantic magic. Aznagarb, the cleric, after taking refuge in a hidden temple in the Thorn Forest, provided the necessary tools for Benork's revenge, consisting mainly of a divinely imbued set that only those who hated magic with all their hearts could use.

The boots represent the name of Benork's royal ancestry. In the name of his Ancestors, he would have to seek the death of the necromancers.

- Hit Points: D8
- Can assign 2 proficiency points to Weapon and Shield Style and Single-Weapon Style; and 3 points to Two-Weapon Style.

Every 10 levels, 1 use will be added to each projectile accordingly.

Level 1: Explosive Arrow - At LVL 20, additional damage: Acid
Level 3: Explosive Bullet - At LVL 20, additional damage: Electric
Level 5: Explosive Bolt - At LVL 20, additional damage: Magic
Level 7: Explosive Dart - At LVL 20, additional damage: Cold

- Only receive 15 points per level to assign to skills.
- -1 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma during character creation.~

@800022  = ~And why would you do that? You’ve said it yourself. I have little respect for summoned beings.~
@800023  = ~No one said that, Frostmaster. On the contrary, I am convinced that there is room for your arcane redemption.~
@800024  = ~I wouldn’t offer you such power otherwise.~
@800025  = ~Hm. Very well. Do what you must. And make it quick. Unlike you, I’m not comfortable being half-naked.~

@800027  = ~You weren’t exaggerating about haste. Is it... is it done? It’s... it’s true...~
@800028  = ~The change is significant. I fail to comprehend how a creature of the Astral Plane, bound to a ring, can wield so much power.~

@90168   = ~Ehm... *coughs* Yeah, that's it.~

@9029    = ~Why do you say that? Emotions are useful to us, Alendir.~
@90210   = ~I agree with you, Alendir. Emotions are nothing but unnecessary baggage in our minds and hearts.~
@90211   = ~Yes, I know what you'll say. Gemystara used to say the same thing. Perhaps that's why she fell in love with a human.~
@90212   = ~*sigh* Perhaps I was wrong in my beliefs. My hatred was irrational towards that race. I only hated humans because the woman I loved fell in love with one of them.~

@90233   = ~<CHARNAME>, I ask because I've been thinking a lot about Gemystara. You must understand that speaking of her is something I've never done with any other mortal or immortal creature. My confessions have only been poured onto paper through ink and sleepless nights.~

@90816 = ~Anyway, I'm not here to talk about that. I was sent to this stinking place, infested with filthy pirates, just to test you.~
@90817 = ~A test? Ha! What test can a pathetic wizard like you impose on us, elf?~
@90818 = ~Do you have to provoke a confrontation, Dusk? We have more pressing matters to attend to here.~
@90819 = ~You must be careful, Dusk. Just as the bat cannot find food when the wind roars strongly, I have not been able to find a gram of nature in this elven creature.~
@90820 = ~*laughs* Who would have thought, abbil? You have some racial violence inside you. I think the surface elves deserve it...~
@90821 = ~Hmm... this elf has a strange energy around him, stick man. However, I do not think he is a match for my spells. (No, I do not think he is...)~
@90822 = ~I spit on your threats, ye trash elf. Skinny legs, just give the word and I will dismember him for ye.~
@90823 = ~White crow, I must say that this Kalanda has a mysterious strength in him. We should not take his threats lightly.~
@90824 = ~My Order is powerful, Wizard Slayer. You may have trained with Snake Eyes to improve your arcane resistance... but that will not be enough.~
@90825 = ~Wh-What?! How do you know that, elf? Speak, or you will die right now!~
@90826 = ~Is that supposed to be a joke? I don't understand human humor... it seems pathetic to me.~
@90827 = ~No, I will not speak, Wizard Slayer. And no, it is not my time to die either.~
@90828 = ~But it will be yours if you don't pass this test.~
@90829 = ~Watch this carefully!~
@90830 = ~You look surprised, Wizard Slayer.~

@90834 = ~I think Dusk is right. There must be some trick behind this, sorcerer... what is it?~
@90835 = ~Are you serious? These creatures are no match for us, Kalanda.~
@90836 = ~What are you really plotting?~
@90837 = ~Appearances can give you a false impression, <CHARNAME>. You should know it... and you will know it...~
@90838 = ~Very perceptive, <CHARNAME>. Both of you make a good team. But that won't save you.~
@90839 = ~Failing this test will mean death, <CHARNAME> and Dusk. And rest assured: this will not be the last time our paths cross!~

@90840 = ~<CHARNAME>, be careful! I sense a particular energy in him... he's a Transmuter.~
@90841 = ~D-dusk! Calm down. You're not the only one who will use all their strength to defend <CHARNAME>. You have more than one friend by your side.~
@90842 = ~Ah, yes, the typical plot of the Transmuter elf. I remember Golodon used many spells from that school. Once he summoned a turtle, which was the size of my knee. Golodon cast a transformation spell on it and it grew in size, to the point that we decided to build a little house on top of its shell and live there for a good while. Those were good times. What I mean, Dusk, is that you should pay attention to this elf. He may have intentions of doing something bad with his transmutations.~
@90843 = ~What?! How do you know that? Speak! Don't make me kill you, Kalanda.~
@90844 = ~What do you mean? If you try to harm <CHARNAME>, your head will roll, Kalanda!~

@90912   = ~I'm not a courtesan! Don't you see this crossbow? Tsk! I thought you city folk were more perceptive.~
@90913   = ~That doesn't matter. I can afford something you might consider an easy job.~

@90919   = ~I understand. But how do you plan to do that? I don't think the owners will just release them.~
@90920   = ~No! This can be resolved without resorting to violence.~
@90921   = ~The plan is much simpler. We can... bribe one of the employees to release the animals into the southern woods of the city.~
@90922   = ~And why do you need me? It looks like you have everything pretty well sorted.~
@90923   = ~I think your plan stinks, Fall. But well, who am I to judge.~
@90924   = ~And what would be my role in all this?~
@90925   = ~Well, I don't think so! Certainly, it's much better than fighting your way through.~
@90926   = ~I don't count on that either, my <LADYLORD>.~
@90927   = ~The man I intend to bribe is asking for an excessive amount of gold. Something I can't afford. Perhaps traveling with a group of adventurers could help me gather the amount he's asking for.~
@90928   = ~As a reward, I would give you a precious gem. It has no value to me, but it might to you.~
@90929   = ~I can take on the job, Fall. But I don't need another member in my group.~
@90930   = ~I see. It might be useful to have an extra hand. How do I know you would be of use in my group?~
@90931   = ~No thanks. It would be better if you seek help elsewhere.~
@90932   = ~It's obvious that many think something like this isn't worth it, but I think it is! Besides, I need help.~
@90933   = ~No! I must be present when you speak with the circus man. That's non-negotiable. This is important to me, and if you're going to help me, I'll be with you until the end.~

@90945    = ~Ah! Look who's back to talk to good old Fall. No, no look, dwarf sir, I wasn't talking to you. *clears throat* So? I hope you've changed your mind.~
@90946    = ~Actually, yes. You can travel with us, Fall.~
@90947    = ~Not for now, half-elf.~

@9665    = ~We all do. Even you, little one.~
@9666    = ~Yes, b-but... you changed because of an external factor.~
@9667    = ~Yes... the scarlet orb. Perhaps, it simply brought out my true personality. My true self.~
@9668    = ~No, I don't think that's the case, Dusk. I think you can go back to who you were. It's not too late.~

@96612   = ~I understand. Go ahead and ask, my friend.~
@96613   = ~What does the Amn army do with... deserters?~
@96614   = ~Hmm... when I was a squire, I didn't see too many situations like that. But from what I have seen, immediate expulsion from the army. In some cases, imprisonment.~
@96615   = ~Why do you ask?~
@96616   = ~Oh, it's nothing... basically... I never returned to Cormyr after my encounter with the orcs.~
@96617   = ~I suppose that counts as... desertion.~
@96618   = ~Oh, I see...~
@96619   = ~Yes... well, thank you for your time, Anomen.~

@966139  = ~Yes, I am aware of it, but I have not had the pleasure of being there. How did you obtain it?~
@966140  = ~I betrayed my allies. I used their life force to release a Shadow Fiend. Currently, my soul is bound to it.~
@966141  = ~I see. A understandable path. Those who are not born with inherent power are often driven to seek it out through their actions.~
@966142  = ~I don't know if obligation was what I felt... but yes, I understand what you mean.~
@966143  = ~I know. I've seen what you can do on the battlefield. Without a doubt, <CHARNAME> has gained powerful allies.~

@966181  = ~Why do you say such things, Dusk? There's no need to be so pessimistic. Life isn't as cruel as you always say.~

@966183  = ~*in a deep voice* "Remember: no one will hit you as hard as life itself."~
@966184  = ~*chuckles* Sounds very grim. Why are you looking at me like that? Didn't you like my "Dusk, the serious" impression?~
@966185  = ~Let's keep going.~
@966186  = ~All right, all right... and by the way: I'll heed your advice. Thanks for always being on the front lines, Dusk.~
@966187  = ~And keep in mind that I intend for your stay with us to be long: my crossbow and I will take care of that.~
@966188  = ~Good to know.~

@966189  = ~I still haven't decided, Dusk: I don't know if you look younger or older with that appearance.~
@966190  = ~Well... I don't feel either younger or older. Why do you ask, Fall?~
@966191  = ~Well, certainly, after your... "absorption" of the purified orb, you've changed. Although not so much now that I think about it.~
@966192  = ~My wolves adore you. Not that they didn't before, but now it's as if they sense in you a deeper connection to nature.~
@966193  = ~I think it's the work of the orb, Fall. That Daren and Sinna sense it confirms it even more.~
@966194  = ~And regarding your observation... I think I feel older. I don't know if my appearance shows it or not... but certainly, the orb has consumed part of my vital energy.~
@966195  = ~Oh... I see.~
@966196  = ~*smiles* Cheer up, Fall. We still have plenty of time. When this is over, we can travel together through Shilmista, if you wish.~
@966197  = ~Really? There's nothing I'd like more, Dusk. It's a promise.~

@966202  = ~I'm not a girl, Dusk! And no, I don't fear you! It's just that... you've changed...~
@966203  = ~That's right. Now I harbor a power greater than before. Such is the power of Pandemonium.~
@966204  = ~As if that mattered. Power? The Dusk I knew never prioritized power. The Dusk I knew was kind. A bit serious, perhaps, but his heart held kindness.~
@966205  = ~But now... it's as if...~
@966206  = ~As if it didn't exist? It's because the Dusk you mention no longer exists. It's just me.~
@966207  = ~I don't think that's true, Dusk... despite your personality and appearance having changed... I feel that you're still you...~
@966208  = ~Within that darkness you emanate... I feel that the Dusk I knew still exists.~

// Talk 1
@9673    = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd like to think that we are battle comrades. We've been through a lot in Dreach-naga and Rachnidra. Do you agree with me?~
@9674    = ~It's true, Cho. We have fought too much in the Abyss. Our victory over Morgrath was sublime at the very least.~
@9675    = ~We've fought a lot together, yes. But that doesn't make us friends. We are more of a coincidence of events.~
@9676    = ~I don't have time to talk, Cho. Maybe another time, yes?~
@9677    = ~I understand. I apologize for interrupting your mission. Let's continue.~
@9678    = ~Then we understand each other. You saved my life, and fighting for you while I know the Material Plane is one of the reasons that allows me to move forward.~
@9679    = ~However, my intention is to inquire about certain matters I don't fully understand. About all this divine war you are waging.~
@96710   = ~I'm listening, friend. What do you want to know?~
@96711   = ~I truly don't have time for this, Cho. Let's leave it for another occasion.~
@96712   = ~Maybe I was wrong to consider you a friend as you say. The concepts we deal with in Dreach-naga are somewhat different.~
@96713   = ~The creatures you must defeat... I even believe those you have defeated, are they your siblings?~
@96714   = ~We come from the same father, so in a sense, they are my kin. However, I am not the one who decided to kill them. It is them or me. If I lose, it is very likely they will conquer these lands.~
@96715   = ~I don't consider them that way. Some have declared themselves my enemies and have tried to kill me at the first opportunity they had. I have only defended myself from their attacks.~
@96716   = ~I have defeated and must defeat my siblings, Cho. Only then can I claim what is rightfully mine.~
@96717   = ~I read a phrase in one of the books I found in the Abyss. "Blood does not end in family." It belonged to a knight who died fighting. When I killed him, I took that book from his belongings.~
@96718   = ~That phrase defines much of the spirit of my nation. When I read it... I felt great remorse for ending the life of that warrior.~
@96719   = ~Have you had many similar experiences, Cho? I mean, regretting killing invaders.~
@96720   = ~It's correct that you did, Cho. You had to protect your own.~
@96721   = ~Your thirst for power reminds me of my Queen. Though I'd rather not talk or comment about it. I want to talk to you about something else:~
@96722   = ~I think you must have guessed by now, but I've annihilated many invaders from the Material Plane when they arrived in Dreach-naga. Not by my own desire, but by order of my Queen, Tisiphone.~
@96723   = ~It seemed logical to me to learn Common Tongue, as learning about the enemy is a necessary step in martial mastery. When I read that phrase from the knight, he had been dead for years. Reading that phrase reminded me of that battle.~
@96724   = ~He seemed not to know how he had come to the Abyss... there are many abyssal traps in this Plane that lead you to the Abyss when you least expect it.~
@96725   = ~But he also did not hesitate to attack me when he saw me. Which I understand. I am not a beautiful creature in the eyes of the primordials. To be fair, you aren't beautiful to us either. I even testify that many lizardmen fear you.~
@96726   = ~Eradicating fear from my troops was achieved through arduous training sessions. Fear turned into hatred, which was not my intention.~
@96727   = ~Turning that hatred into focus was harder than any combat session in the Rask'tar Marshes.~
@96728   = ~Do you feel that for the relatives you must annihilate?~
@96729   = ~I do not feel hatred for my enemies, Cho. In fact, I have no desire to go to war for a divine claim. I go because I have no other alternative.~
@96730   = ~Of course, Cho. Hatred strengthens me. It feeds me with power and makes my combat against my opponents more effective.~
@96731   = ~Interesting. I will think about your words, <CHARNAME>.~


// Talk 2
@96732  = ~<CHARNAME>, have I ever told you about how we came to ally with the Yuan-Ti in Dreach-naga?~

@96734  = ~I might have a faint memory of it. But I wouldn't mind if you told me again, Cho.~
@96735  = ~No, Cho. And I'm not interested. We're very busy at the moment. It's best to leave it for another time.~
@96736  = ~For years, the Yuan-Ti and the Lizardfolk waged a bloody war for the dominance of Dreach-naga. To the point where we brought our people to the brink of extinction.~
@96737  = ~It wasn't until Tisiphone arrived that this changed. As you know and have seen, Tisiphone was a serpent-like humanoid creation. Possibly horrid to you, but certainly wonderful to us.~
@96738  = ~She had the powerful designs of basilisks and the grace of jaculis. Not belonging to any particular tribe and able to sustain herself with her great power, it was only a matter of time before she could present herself as a hope for both races.~
@96739  = ~It was her idea to create a communal upbringing in both races, meaning we did not distinguish preferences when raising the eggs, regardless of their origin.~
@96740  = ~It didn't take many years for the Lizardfolk and Yuan-Ti to consider each other as brothers and sisters and for Dreach-naga to become a nation at peace, united against foreign invasions.~
@96741  = ~I think I know where you're going with this, Cho. You're intrigued by the Bhaalspawn war, aren't you?~
@96742  = ~Indeed. If the Yuan-Ti and the Lizardfolk managed to find peace and prosper together despite all past transgressions, why can't you?~
@96743  = ~But I'm not naive.~
@96744  = ~I understand what you're referring to. The Bhaalspawn are individual entities that, for the most part, seem to discern what is at stake. A great divine power.~
@96745  = ~This war I fight for you... will be the last of my life. I will die for you on the battlefield... or I will survive to witness your victory and then, I can choose my path.~
@96746  = ~Remember this, my good friend: We have lived under the shadow of others' desires. We have been soldiers in wars we did not choose... but the day will come when we can choose what to do with the rest of our days.~
@96747  = ~I admit that Bhaal is a matter very foreign to my knowledge of this Plane. Although I am gradually coming to understand the influence you mention. Bhaal absent, Tisiphone absent. And yet, it seems their presence surrounds us at all times.~
@96748  = ~Despite this, I still believe the following:~
@96749  = ~I am amazed at how similar your thoughts are to the late Tisiphone. My Queen was not always like this, however. Although I've spoken of it before and do not intend to again, <CHARNAME>. Your great power demands my respect, and you shall have it.~
@96750  = ~I wish it were that simple, Cho. I can't speak for others, but it's difficult to find peace when a terrible power is at stake.~
@96751  = ~You have seen what some of the Bhaalspawn are capable of. You'll understand that reasoning with some is impossible.~
@96752  = ~Not all can be reasoned with, Cho. In your case, a figure of power emerged that unified the peoples. In our case, Bhaal is that figure of power and he is cruel and sadistic. Only destruction will result from his influence.~
@96753  = ~I'm not interested in forging alliances with beings inferior to me, Cho. The rest of my "siblings" are trying to kill me. For that, they will pay with their lives.~
@96754  = ~A topic too complex to discuss now. There are more important things to do at the moment, Cho.~
@96755  = ~Peace is not that complex, <CHARNAME>. It may be ironic that someone who has lived their entire life at war tells you this... but it gives you a perspective on what peace is.~

@96821 = ~The scarlet orb... Why have you given it to me, Anthagar?~
@96822 = ~As a scholar of Velsharoon, it is my duty to study all aspects of life and death. In both, using the appropriate instructions, hidden power can be found.~
@96823 = ~I see... this mysterious necromancer speaks of powers similar (or perhaps superior) to the Nether Scroll. Stick man, let him continue talking. He may have something interesting to say...~

@96827 = ~Hmph... I knew it. <CHARNAME>, we must be careful. Most likely, a difficult battle lies ahead...~
@96828 = ~In our next encounter, captain... we shall settle the score... For now... Survive my faithful followers!~
@96829 = ~But... I don't understand... Snake Eyes fell by my sword... How is that, in any way, beneficial to you?~
@96830 = ~Hmph! Snake Eyes was aware of the situation, captain. He simply played his part in the grand scheme: A tale oft told, more perceived than intricate: a shadow looms by death's cold touch conceived...~

@96831 = ~Back then you wouldn't have been able to comprehend the why. And now, even less so...~
@96832 = ~I have offered you a power beyond imagination, Aldant. But you have rejected it.~
@96833 = ~You tread upon a path of loyalty and trust where fools and their whims will lead you to doom.~

@96835 = ~Evil-doer! It is clear that Minsc, Boo, Dusk, and <CHARNAME> will foil your plans. We will kick your magical butt left and right!~
@96836 = ~I know you have cunning allies. That leprechaun from Shilmista and the elven archer have been with you from the start.~

@96837 = ~Even the influence of this child of Bhaal may have had something to do with it...~
@96838 = ~But that doesn't matter, Ardusk Aldant of Cormyr. In another situation, I would have tested your power... but now, I can't risk my enterprise with you.~

'In the depths of my little burrow,
I sigh with love for a halfling so fair.
In her eyes, I find the true light,
and my heart fills with stars.'~

I am a mouse who loves you with ardor.

Therefore, if you see him injured, heal him and you may have better luck convincing him to work for you.~

@97215    = ~Uma is older than she appears. In fact, from her fur (and other... qualities) you'll notice that she's not a common wolf.

@97530   = ~In Brost, everyone holds equal status: druids, rangers, scouts, cart builders, and brewers. Men and elves, whether attuned to nature or not, work together to maintain a life of peace and harmony between the village's inhabitants and the forest.~
@97531   = ~A few years ago, the forest was attacked by poachers from the south. With the alliance of the inhabitants of Brost, the attack was repelled and the forest saved. Now the men face an economic crisis, and I have decided to come to Athkatla with Hakamir to remedy that issue.~
@97532   = ~If you need magical artifacts, Hakamir can provide them. As for me, I can enchant boots of speed to enhance their magical properties. For a price, of course. Druids don't need gold, but I do it for Brost. What we get here will go towards the village repairs.~
@97533   = ~Greetings, Northern Walker. Acrull Northshield is here to help his friend Hakamir gather the necessary funds to assist with repairs in Brost, the Mushroom Village. Remember, if you have boots of speed, I can enhance their enchantment.~

@97540   = ~Divine Boots will allow the cleric or druid to improve their connection with their deities, enhancing their spell memorization. I can also apply this to wizards, which would be Arcane Boots. Either of these would cost around 15000 gold pieces.~

@97545   = ~I want the Divine Boots, Acrull.~
@97546   = ~I want the Arcane Boots, Acrull.~

@97550   = ~Certainly. Here you go. *You hand over a pair of boots of speed*~
@97551   = ~Very well. It won't take me long to apply the necessary enchantments...~
@97552   = ~Done. The work is complete, Walker. Here you go. If you have another pair, feel free to come back.~


@97554  = ~Hm... interesting. I can enhance them, yes. I understand they belonged to Duke Benork. He was a good man. I assume you'll put them to good use, Walker.~
@97555  = ~Here you go. No charge. You'll notice the improvement immediately. If you need anything else, you know where to find me.~
@97556  = ~I've just changed my mind, Acrull. I need to think about it a bit more.~
@97557  = ~Acrull, do you think you could do something to improve this pair of boots? They are called the Ancestor's Path Boots.~

@97558  = ~The inhabitants of the Mushrooms suffer from the nearby wars to our nation, Fall. Hakamir has convinced me to help him gather gold to recover losses from trades and the damage the poachers have inflicted on our people.~
@97559  = ~I understand. Is there anything I can do to help?~
@97560  = ~You can convince your friend to buy some of our artifacts if he wishes. They're not cheap, though. But they're worth it for their enchantments.~ ~You can convince your friend to buy some of our artifacts if she wishes. They're not cheap, though. But they're worth it for their enchantments.~
@97561  = ~Our good druid is more than willing to provide his famous magical enhancements to boots, isn't that right, Acrull?~
@97562  = ~That's right, Fall. If they have Boots of Speed, I can enhance them. If it were up to me, I'd do it for free, but Hakamir says we need the gold and can't dispense with its use.~
@97563  = ~Fortunately, our new friend, Mathyus Davis, allows us to be here without charging us anything.~
@97564  = ~*clears throat* Technically, this place belongs to someone named Aran Linvail. I rented it in exchange for a good Shilmista bow. He likes elven things, you know?~
@97565  = ~That explains a lot. You've made a good deal, Mathyus.~
@97566  = ~Of course, Captain. Your servant, Mathyus Davis, is as good with the bow as he is with the tongue.~
@97567  = ~It's good to know you're doing something for Brost, my good friends. Mother would be proud of you.~
@97568  = ~By the way, where is Gemystara? I thought we'd find her here, but I haven't heard from her, Fall.~
@97569  = ~I... prefer not to talk about it, Hakamir, I hope you understand.~
@97570  = ~I see... Very well, Fall. I won't intrude where I'm not wanted.~
@97571  = ~If you're in trouble, you know you can turn to us, child.~
@97572  = ~I know, Acrull. I am grateful. For now, perhaps <CHARNAME> can help you by buying some of your items.~

@97573  = ~Aren't you concerned about Danctian's presence, Acrull?~
@97574  = ~The matter is more complex than you think, Northwalker. Danctian Shadow comes from the Plane of Pandemonium, yet he is not a creature inherent to it.~
@97575  = ~Have you seen how Mathyus, Michelson, and Demolisher died at the hands of Dusk? Their bodies disappeared over the hours at an unnatural speed. They died here, but they live in Pandemonium.~
@97576  = ~...~
@97577  = ~I don't blame Dusk for not talking about it. It's a... situation more difficult than he or anyone could admit. As surprising as it may seem, Danctian's presence here hasn't affected the Balance, as long as Mathyus remains in Pandemonium.~
@97578  = ~That is why I have urged Hakamir not to leave Athkatla just yet. I don't know if you've noticed, but here, both Hakamir and I have a protection, induced by our combined arcane and innate powers.~
@97579  = ~Danctian could have broken that bond and finished us off. But he hasn't. His plan doesn't seem to want to alter the Balance of Faerûn, but, as strange as it may seem, to safeguard it. In time, you'll understand what I mean.~
@97580  = ~For now, if you need my assistance in anything or Hakamir for trade, don't hesitate to come to us.~

@97581  = ~Strangely, Acrull is right. He doesn't seem to be an evil creature, at least not in the concepts we understand. His inference is closer to the Balance than I'd like to admit. That doesn't mean we should stop observing him, just in case.~
@97582  = ~Like the bark beetle that attacks ancient trees, killing them, so is Danctian's presence in this Plane, <CHARNAME>. But the death of the tree becomes food for fungi, moss, and small animals. Perpetuating life through death is a way to maintain the Balance.~
@97583  = ~His presence, though unsettling, doesn't distort the Balance, but rather, strangely, maintains it. At least, for now. Can the beetle evolve into an unnatural force? I don't think so, but I couldn't say the same about a shadow demon. We must remain vigilant.~

@97647  = ~Thank you for your welcome, Phillipe. So this is your... home?~
@97648  = ~I don't have time for this. Goodbye, Phillipe.~
@97649  = ~Come visit Phillipe again soon! Phillipe enjoys your company.~
@97650  = ~Abandoned refuge is Phillipe's home, yes. Well... not so much a home. Being alone, I'm not sure if it can be called a home. Phillipe no longer has siblings. Nor company.~
@97651  = ~You can rest here! There aren't many places to rest in this land. Shamanic energies disturb dreams. Can't sleep. Here you can sleep.~
@97652  = ~I understand. You don't like being alone, do you?~
@97653  = ~Thank you, Phillipe. But I must go now. See you later.~
@97654  = ~No. Phillipe doesn't like being alone. Being your friend is Phillipe's only happiness in recent months. Phillipe is not as sad anymore.~
@97655  = ~I wish you could stay with me. We would be good siblings.~
@97656  = ~There is another place that is also safe. Vidomina's Enclave.~
@97657  = ~I'll think about it, Phillipe. I must go now. We'll talk later.~
@97658  = ~Vido...mina? You mean the dead sorceress, right? Phillipe thinks she hates Phillipe.~
@97659  = ~Phillipe doesn't believe she would allow Phillipe to live in her Enclave.~
@97660  = ~I can talk to her if you want. Believe it or not, I think she knows who you are. I don't think she'd have a problem letting you stay in her Enclave.~
@97661  = ~You might be right, little one. Well, I must go. We'll talk later, yes?~
@97662  = ~Would... would you do that for Phillipe? Very very well. Phillipe will wait here for your answer, my good friend.~

@97663  = ~Ah! Phillipe's friends arrive again. How are things going? Phillipe is excited.~
@97664  = ~Vidomina wants you to live in her Enclave. You'll be safe there. She gave me this talisman for you. With it, you'll be able to enter her chamber.~
@97665  = ~I still need to talk to Vidomina, Phillipe. Wait here.~
@97666  = ~I was just stopping by to say hello, Phillipe. Now I must go.~
@97667  = ~Really? Oh, what a happy day! Phillipe promises not to be afraid of the dead. Or at least of these dead. I hope you, my good friend, visit Phillipe, yes?~ 
@97668  = ~Oh, good news, good news! Phillipe will wait here then. Phillipe is excited!~


@97669  = ~Friend! Lady Vidomina and her friends have welcomed me warmly. I will be safe here. Phillipe feels like he's gained a new family. Thank you, thank you, thank you.~ ~Friend! Lady Vidomina and her friends have welcomed me warmly. I will be safe here. Phillipe feels like she's gained a new family. Thank you, thank you, thank you.~

@97671  = ~Phillipe wants to thank friend. Phillipe gives strange artifact that Phillipe found in his travels. It may not seem like much, but hopes it pleases my good friend.~ ~Phillipe wants to thank friend. Phillipe gives strange artifact that Phillipe found in his travels. It may not seem like much, but hopes it pleases my good friend.~

@97672  = ~<CHARNAME>... i-is it true what I heard?~
@97673  = ~Are you... are you going to face Skel'Tharant?~
@97674  = ~I haven't decided yet, Phillipe. But considering what Vidomina has told us, it's very likely that confrontation is inevitable.~
@97675  = ~I plan to kill him before my final battle against Morgrath. Why do you ask, little friend?~
@97676  = ~No! Please, don't do it. Skel'Tharant killed Phillipe's family. Don't want him to kill you too. Don't do it. The beast... it can't be killed. Phillipe saw countless brave warriors try... all were devoured by Skel'Tharant.~
@97677  = ~Phillipe? *nervous* W-what can Phillipe do to help?~
@97678  = ~N-no! No... Phillipe can't do it... Phillipe is afraid... Skel'Tharant...~
@97679  = ~Phillipe, don't be a coward! You better be willing to help us. I've done a lot for you, and I expect something in return.~
@97680  = ~Phillipe, don't worry. I'm not afraid of Skel'Tharant. I'm certain I can defeat him even without that magic oil.~
@97681  = ~Phillipe, I understand that you're scared. I would be too. But didn't Skel'Tharant kill your family? Weren't your siblings slain by that beast you fear so much?~
@97682  = ~N-no! *trembles* Please... Phillipe can't do it...~
@97683  = ~T-thanks for understanding Phillipe, good friend. S-sorry for being such a coward...~
@97684  = ~<CHARNAME>, Phillipe regrets not being able to help. S-sorry...~
@97685  = ~It's true... it's true. Skel'Tharant... killed family. Phillipe has a chance for revenge.~
@97686  = ~Help me, Phillipe. Together we will make Skel'Tharant pay for what he did to your family.~
@97687  = ~Yes... Yes! Phillipe will help <CHARNAME>. Phillipe will help Lady Vidomina.~
@97688  = ~Phillipe will help <CHARNAME> in the fight against Skel'Tharant!~

@97689  = ~No! Skel'Tharant will not kill <CHARNAME>!~
@97690  = ~I-I... I...~
@97691  = ~Phillipe! Give me the oil, I'll take care of the rest.~
@97692  = ~Phillipe! Run! You won't outrun the monster. I can defeat it without the oil.~
@97693  = ~No! Skel'Tharant is wrong. Phillipe is not afraid. Phillipe will avenge his brothers!~


@97694  = ~<CHARNAME> killed Skel'Tharant! Phillipe can't believe it. <CHARNAME> is as powerful as a god. Phillipe will be forever grateful to <CHARNAME> for avenging his brothers. Gratitude, gratitude!~
@97695  = ~Phillipe... Phillipe is alive! Or is he...? Remember fighting Skel'Tharant...~
@97696  = ~Oh, Phillipe is happy. We are no longer in the Abyss! This place is more beautiful than Rachnidra, that's for sure. <CHARNAME>, Phillipe is glad to see friend alive.~
@97697  = ~I'm also glad to see you alive, Phillipe.~
@97698  = ~Visit Phillipe and his friends whenever you want, <CHARNAME>. <CHARNAME> will always be Phillipe's friend.~
@97699  = ~Phillipe is in Faerûn! Not on the surface but enjoying the sewers. It's a much more picturesque place than Rachnidra.~
@976100 = ~Travelers are in the spider caves... I'd tell you to be careful, but Phillipe hasn't seen a spider in days. Strange, very strange.~
@976101 = ~<CHARNAME>, defeated Skel'Tharant! Phillipe... is surprised. <CHARNAME> has incredible power.~

@9770    = ~Little one, why do you stare at me so much?~
@9771    = ~Oh, Cho! I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...~
@9772    = ~Do not apologize; that is a sign of weakness. And I do not think you are weak.~
@9773    = ~D-do you really think so?~
@9774    = ~Yes! Cho'Nuja never associates with weak creatures. The hatchling Aerie has proven her worth by using her shamanic powers on more than one occasion.~
@9775    = ~Ah, you mean my arcane and divine abilities.~
@9776    = ~I understand. The arcane and the divine. I still haven't gotten used to those terms. Your world is fascinating.~
@9777    = ~Do you enjoy learning about our customs?~
@9778    = ~Many seem strange to me, but yes. Learning about the surface world and enjoying its sun is something I greatly enjoy.~
@9779    = ~What do you find strange?~
@97710   = ~I thought you would be more... primitive. For example, you bury your dead. You perform funeral rites.~
@97711   = ~And what did you expect in those cases?~
@97712   = ~The logical thing: Eating the dead.~
@97713   = ~Oh, my...~
@97714   = ~Do not worry, little one. Dreach-naga abandoned those customs due to my intervention. For years, the fallen were not devoured but were given to an emerald fire pyre so that their souls could be freed from the Abyss.~
@97715   = ~The fire here is yellow, like topaz. It's just as beautiful. *growl* Anyway, I just wanted to say that I am relieved to see that you do not devour your fallen.~
@97716   = ~Well... I feel the same way, Cho.~

@97717   = ~Judging by your fighting style, you would have made an excellent recruit in my ranks, soldier.~
@97718   = ~Joining your army is something entirely incompatible with my beliefs, lizard-man.~
@97719   = ~I understand. It's something your god would not allow, correct?~
@97720   = ~Your kind here hasn't maintained a peaceful relationship with Amn. I reckon that, had you been born here, we would have been enemies.~
@97721   = ~But I was not born here, soldier. I am from Dreach-naga.~
@97722   = ~I'm well aware, General. The fact that you have adapted our customs for the better is something worth mentioning.~
@97723   = ~*growl* We are in agreement on that.~

@97724   = ~General, I must say you have quickly adapted to our world. Like the starlings, you have embraced the new tree of a distant land and called it home.~
@97725   = ~Dreach-naga is not so different from this land, shaman. Though the absence of what you call the sun is the most noticeable. The warm, bright light is good for my scales.~
@97726   = ~The sun is like a lion in its Kingdom. It stands out for the majesty its being exudes.~
@97727   = ~Well, now that you mention it, you're not so different from the shamans of my Swamp.~
@97728   = ~They have that wisdom and connection with beings outside their own race that few creatures can achieve.~
@97729   = ~The druid's work is arduous, and the call of Mother Nature must not be ignored. It's something intrinsic that cannot be fully explained with words.~
@97730  = ~Your voice, like the wind of this land, does not escape my ears. We'd better keep going, shaman.~


@97731  = ~Your shamanic abilities are exceptional. Your mystical powers surpass many of the most experienced yuan-ti I have known.~
@97732  = ~That's only natural, lizard. Edwin Odesseiron wields arcane power like few others. And stop calling me a shaman! I am a mage. (Yes, a very powerful one)~
@97733  = ~True. It is hard to break the habit of my draconic tongue. The common language is very diverse. Mage it is, then.~

@97734  = ~My giant flying drake. I thought it would take you longer to get used to these lands, but you've adapted like a true dancing chameleon.~
@97735  = ~Cho'Nuja has been in more extreme situations than this. Besides, you've also had to go through the same process. You are not from this plane.~
@97736  = ~Well, that's true. I had to flee due to some rather embarrassing reasons. But be that as it may, we're not so different.~
@97737  = ~I think we're very different, furry one. But I understand what you mean.~

@97738  = ~What are you staring at, little one?~ 
@97739  = ~Hm... at how profoundly boring you are, Cho.~
@97740  = ~Boring? I do not understand.~
@97741  = ~Well, you carry nothing but those blades attached to your arms. It's very hard to steal anything from you.~
@97742  = ~Ah, yes. My Shehad Ibahaliic. You know, in your Common Tongue, they mean--~
@97743  = ~You don't even wear clothes. I mean, I just realized you walk around naked.~
@97744  = ~Naked? Ah, you mean those skins you wear. I don't see why you wouldn't abandon them. It's a source of pride for me that beings admire my scales.~
@97745  = ~There aren't many lizard ladies around here, are there?~
@97746  = ~That's... true. Perhaps you can talk to <CHARNAME> to change that a bit.~
@97747  = ~In exchange, maybe I could get you some precious gems. I have a good eye for them, you know?~
@97748  = ~We just made a deal, my good friend.~

@97749  = ~I don't know if I've mentioned this before, General, but I admire the way you seek Balance in your actions.~
@97750  = ~Balance? What do you mean, soldier?~
@97751  = ~The coexistence and constant struggle between the forces representing good and evil in the world. I'm referring to the mystical and philosophical concept that encompasses harmony and cosmic order.~
@97752  = ~I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@97753  = ~Have you never read about Balance while in the Abyss?~
@97754  = ~I haven't had the pleasure, battle companion. In Dreach-naga, survival was always what mattered. The Abyss is not a friendly place, and death was a daily matter to deal with.~
@97755  = ~I think I understand, Cho. Despite what you've told me, your exile to this world has been in a natural and respectable manner.~
@97756  = ~It is something that could only be achieved by the experience I have accumulated throughout my existence. The wisdom we extract from our actions molds and defines us.~
@97757  = ~I couldn't have put it better, my good friend.~


@97758  = ~It's hard to believe in my mind that turnips don't exist in your world, Chonchito.~
@97759  = ~Well, no, my furry friend. I believe that food is more suited to this plane.~
@97760  = ~Sure, sure. But let me tell you that if Uncle Gerardo had wanted to, he would've figured out some formula to make turnips sprout like grass in those swamps you love so much. A good diet of turnips is what a good reptile needs.~
@97761  = ~What is an uncle?~
@97762  = ~Oh, well, you see... wait a minute, are you telling me that there are no uncles among reptiles? I find that hard to believe. All living creatures have to have the capacity to have uncles, you know? Even those filthy griffons that have caused so much harm to the gnome race must have uncles. It can be a complicated relationship depending on the region you come from, you know? I've heard chilling stories about Calimshan.~
@97763  = ~In Dreach-naga, we had communal upbringing. Lizardfolk, yuan-ti, jaculis. We're born from eggs and do not distinguish races. Dreach-naga was a united nation.~
@97764  = ~Yes. That reminds me of--~
@97765  = ~I don't mean to disrespect you, my little friend. But the truth is, I don't understand half of the things you talk about.~
@97766  = ~Oh, I see. But... do my stories bother you?~
@97767  = ~As long as it doesn't bother you that I don't understand, not at all.~
@97768  = ~Well, in that case, let me tell you about... *Jan continues talking while Cho occasionally gazes into the distance*~

@97769  = ~General, I must admit, it never crossed my mind to fight alongside a lizardman.~
@97770  = ~Knight, the feeling is mutual. Although I must mention that in my case, it was never a matter of race. A good soldier must follow orders.~
@97771  = ~Are you referring to your Queen? I understand she was deeply distrustful of outsiders.~
@97772  = ~The Abyss is an enticing place for powerful adventurers. Full of mysteries and treasures. But also dangers and promises of pain.~
@97773  = ~My Queen, Tisiphone, always hated everything that was not of our people. Many believed it had always been that way, but it's not true.~
@97774  = ~I see. You loved your Queen, didn't you?~
@97775  = ~I served her for decades. I was always by her side, and only after Gemystara's intervention were my eyes opened.~
@97776  = ~The war against the spiders had infected her heart. To the point where any creature that wasn't a reptile had to die the moment they set foot in Dreach-naga.~
@97777  = ~War shows us facets of ourselves we didn't think we had. It affects everyone, it's inevitable.~
@97778  = ~You're right, knight. You're right.~

@97779  = ~For someone so small, your fury in combat is great.~
@97780  = ~Many long-legs have underestimated me because of my size. And they all ended up with their guts on the ground. Are you looking for the same, you damned lizard?~
@97781  = ~Your dialect is as fierce as the swing of your axe. I didn't mean to insult--~
@97782  = ~Shut your snout, pathetic amphibian. The only reason my axe isn't embedded in your scales is because <CHARNAME> thinks you'll be useful in their damned adventures. Now, get out of here.~
@97783  = ~*whisper* I suppose I need to learn how to socialize better with dwarves...~


@97784  = ~Mazzy, in many ways, you remind me of Vreshnak. She's a yuan-ti with great combat skills despite her size.~
@97785  = ~So everything, even in the Abyss, comes down to size, doesn't it?~
@97786  = ~Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean--~
@97787  = ~I'm joking, Cho. Please, tell me about Vreshnak.~
@97788  = ~Ah, I think I understand. Well, Vreshnak trained with many lizardfolk, including the giant Qyl'tar. She never let herself be intimidated by the strength of her comrades, as Vreshnak compensated for her lack of strength with astonishing agility.~
@97789  = ~Quick and accurate strikes can be more effective than brute force. Yes, I understand what you mean by your comparison.~
@97790  = ~You would have been a great yuan-ti in my army. We would have conquered countless layers of the Abyss.~
@97791  = ~I'm flattered to think that, good General.~
@97792  = ~But those times are past. Conquest isn't everything. I'm beginning to think that enjoying the world might be a more... desirable design for me.~
@97793  = ~In that, we agree, Cho.~

@97794  = ~For the fifth time, warrior. I'm not interested in eating your hamster.~
@97795  = ~Oh, really? Well, Boo thinks otherwise, lizardman. He swears he saw you drooling while looking at his furry coat!~
@97796  = ~Do you really think I would try to eat your friend? *whisper* He's so small he wouldn't even make a bite.~
@97797  = ~What did you say?~
@97798  = ~I said my diet doesn't include eating rodents!~
@97799  = ~Rest assured. I'm not going to eat your Boo. I swear by the memory of my nation: Dreach-naga.~
@977100 = ~Are your oaths like those of Rashemen? Minsc has a great sense of duty, and his word is as strong as the heart of the purest Hathran!~
@977101 = ~In that, we are similar, warrior. My oaths are forever.~
@977102 = ~Oh. Very well. I'll believe your word then. But if I see you even try to taste Boo, I'll come down on you with the full force of my boot!~
@977103 = ~*sigh* That won't be necessary, warrior. We won't get to that point.~



@977104 = ~Cho'Nuja. I've already told you to stop staring at me. Do you want me to cast a cloudkill on you?~
@977105 = ~*growl* What? Little female, why do you avoid me so much? I believe I've proven not to be an enemy to you all.~
@977106 = ~I... I'm sorry, Cho. I didn't mean to disrespect you. It's just... I'm still not used to your form.~
@977107 = ~Form?~
@977108 = ~You bear a certain resemblance to the Shadow Hulks. And I don't have good memories of such creatures.~
@977109 = ~Shadow... hulks? I don't understand.~
@977110 = ~They are large underground creatures. They appear as a horrifying combination of insects and apes. They don't have scales like you but rather a sort of exoskeleton. They spend their time digging, crushing rock and flesh alike. And they are very violent.~
@977111 = ~I think I understand. You refer to the Tonashi. A draconian word we use to name those creatures. Some reached our kingdom and even dug tunnels and devoured many of our young.~
@977112 = ~We fought hard, but we finally managed to exterminate all the Tonashi. Do I remind you of those creatures? I... I'm sorry that is the case.~
@977113 = ~I wasn't referring to their behavior. You've shown honor and even kindness, Cho. I'm sorry... I'm sorry for what I said. You're nothing like the Shadow Hulks or Tonashi, as you call them.~
@977114 = ~I accept your words, little female.~
@977115 = ~Call me Nalia if you want us to get along better, yes?~
@977116 = ~Nalia it is then.~
@977117 = ~That's more like it.~

@977118 = ~You don't seem very uncomfortable when it comes to arcane matters, Cho.~
@977119 = ~Arcane matters?~
@977120 = ~I mean magic. I believe you refer to mages as shamans.~
@977121 = ~I understand. And why should I feel uncomfortable? The great yuan-ti shamans teach the WildGuards to control the inner essence of the warriors.~
@977122 = ~In my case, I can channel my energy into a fiery shield, which we call the Wild Shield of Dreach-naga.~
@977123 = ~It is this ability, of shamanic origin (or arcane, as you call it) that has saved me on more than one occasion.~
@977124 = ~Yes, I understand. I've seen your ability and it surprises me. Tell me, Cho, in your people, magic isn't a priority. I mean, it wouldn't reach the point of corrupting its users to perversion.~
@977125 = ~My people are a nation of physical strength. The warriors are the main defense force of our people.~
@977126 = ~But the shamans have been vital to our survival. They have created protective runes and the ward stones that have kept unwanted visitors out for so long.~
@977127 = ~Why do you ask? I've seen that spells are treated differently here.~
@977128 = ~Magic here has gone astray. The vast majority of its users have gone mad and power-hungry, as is the case with <CHARNAME>'s enemy who stole their soul.~
@977129 = ~You must be careful, Cho. In this plane, magic can be extremely dangerous, and we must be cautious when dealing with it.~
@977130 = ~I will heed your words, human.~


@977131 = ~I have seen some of your kind in my kingdom, shaman.~
@977132 = ~Then you know how dangerous we can be, don't you, linddil?~
@977133 = ~I know it firsthand. However, you don't seem dangerous. At least you haven't shown any aggression toward me.~
@977134 = ~And why would I? You may look like a phindar, but you have proven to be a powerful ally.~
@977135 = ~I suppose that's true.~
@977136 = ~If you have any severe wounds, I will heal you, don't worry.~
@977137 = ~And I will make sure to slash anyone who dares to attack you.~
@977138 = ~I couldn't ask for more, linddil, I couldn't ask for more...~

@9771000 = ~Your combat skills are exceptional, lizard-man. You would have been a good acquisition when I was in Baldur's Gate.~
@9771001 = ~And be an enemy of <CHARNAME>? I don't think we would have defeated him. Besides, I think his perception of power ultimately surpassed yours, Sarevok.~
@9771002 = ~Hm. That's likely. In fact, we've both been his enemies and now follow him, waiting to witness divine power.~
@9771003 = ~Yes. Do you think he'll claim the power that is rightfully his?~
@9771004 = ~He has the ability to do so, yes. Plus, his chances have drastically increased with me by his side. The problem is that the other bastards act together, as a unit.~
@9771005 = ~Though that alliance is destined to fail.~
@9771006 = ~What makes you think our alliance won't end the same way?~
@9771007 = ~I think you and I both know, Jon Cho'Nuja. My little brother is the reason.~ ~I think you and I both know, Jon Cho'Nuja. My little sister is the reason.~

@97810   = ~<CHARNAME>, Gemystara is the name of my mother.~

@97812   = ~Caraneth, my investigations have led me to disturbing theories, but I cannot be certain until I have completed my ritual.~
@97813   = ~Ritual? Does this mean there are interplanar forces involved in my mother's disappearance...?~
@97814   = ~It's quite likely, little one. Now we must determine which plane it is.~
@97815   = ~Hmpf. These pathetic elves are incapable of containing such power. If I had their longevity, the world would already be mine. (Yes, longevity... that would be magnificent)~
@97816   = ~The truth is I don't understand a damn thing, <CHARNAME>. Wake me when these weaklings are done babbling.~
@97817   = ~It seems the search is getting complicated for Fall. I wonder what that old elf will need to perform his ritual.~
@97818   = ~We must be cautious about what this mage asks of us. He may be an elf, but magic is almost tangible around him. Corruption is not a curse exclusive to the human race, <CHARNAME>.~
@97819   = ~Ah, the planes. I once traveled through them, you know? I flew to a strange land where only humans with long legs lived. You couldn't understand a word they said, but the fact is they weren't used to seeing gnomes with crossbows. Everyone screamed, I screamed. It was a strange confusion. Luckily, I was able to return in time to eat old Ma Jansen's lentil stew. By the way, lentil stew after an interplanar journey is not a good combination. You have no idea what came out after... *continues talking*~
@97820   = ~Well, if you ask me, I think this Alendir would be a good addition to the Refuge. He has a sour personality, just what's needed.~
@97821   = ~You, <PRO_RACE>. Do you know what a basilisk is?~
@97822   = ~I do... I have faced those terrible creatures in the past, Alendir. They are capable of petrifying with their gaze.~
@97823   = ~Of course. They are birds with women's breasts. They have quite a sharp sense of humor.~
@97824   = ~No idea. Could you enlighten me, good elf?~
@97825   = ~Very well, <PRO_RACE>.~

@97826   = ~What? You just described a harpy, idiot.~
@97827   = ~The basilisk is a reptilian creature with hard, pale scales. Its gaze is its most fearsome weapon, as it can petrify those who meet it. It has sharp fangs and claws, and a powerful tail, making it a formidable predator.~
@97828   = ~I need one to complete my ritual... A tooth, claw, or scale will suffice.~
@97829   = ~Keep this in mind, spawn of Bhaal. You must face a Greater Basilisk. They are not like normal basilisks. No.~
@97830   = ~Greater Basilisks have orange scales like the sunset sky and are larger than normal basilisks.~
@97831   = ~It's been a while since basilisks have been sighted in Amn, so I recommend you search outside.~
@97832   = ~In the Umar Caves, you will find a good specimen. But it won't be easy to spot... The creature is powerful and remains hidden from the eyes of the hill dwellers.~
@97833   = ~This gem will draw it out of its hiding place. If there are other enemies in the cave, you must eliminate them so the creature will come out. I've also marked the Umar Hills on your map.~
@97834   = ~Do you have any doubts left?~
@97835   = ~Yes. What will my reward be? I'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart, old man.~
@97836   = ~Is it necessary for me to kill the creature?~
@97837   = ~It's clear, Alendir.~
@97838   = ~Ha! Greed fills your heart, <PRO_RACE>. I don't say that it doesn't please me.~
@97839   = ~Here's what we'll do. If you manage to kill the beast and bring me everything you can extract from it, I might be able to imbue an artifact for you.~
@97840   = ~I trust that will be a sufficient reward, don't you think?~
@97841   = ~An artifact forged from the bones of a basilisk. Yes! I hope you don't act like a primate and accept this quest, <CHARNAME>.~
@97842   = ~Hmm... No. Although I don't think the creature would just allow a part of its body to be taken. It's better if you kill it, spawn of Bhaal.~
@97843   = ~After all, you are a descendant of the Murderer, aren't you? Killing shouldn't be a problem for you.~
@97844   = ~Very well. Do this and I'll be able to begin the ritual immediately.~
@97845   = ~So? Have you succeeded in your search?~
@97846   = ~Not yet, Alendir. We haven't been able to find the basilisk.~
@97847   = ~And what are you doing here? Go and find it, <PRO_RACE>! *sigh*~
@97848   = ~I've obtained a Greater Basilisk's fang.~
@97849   = ~I killed it. I brought one of its fangs and some scales. Do you think you can forge something from this?~
@97850   = ~Good job, spawn of Bhaal. Now I have what I need to perform the ritual.~ ~Good job, daughter of Bhaal. Now I have what I need to perform the ritual.~
@97851   = ~Tell me, was it difficult to kill the beast? They can be very challenging creatures to kill.~
@97852   = ~We didn't kill it, Alendir. Will that... affect the ritual?~
@97853   = ~It won't affect it. It's not necessary for the owner of this fang to be dead.~
@97854   = ~However, I wonder: how did you obtain it?~
@97855   = ~Erhm... we simply... talked to it. You see, the Greater Basilisk had an amulet that allowed it to communicate with us. <CHARNAME> convinced it to give us the fang and I...~
@97856   = ~There's no need for further explanations, little Caraneth. I've heard enough.~
@97857   = ~I see you haven't changed at all. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.~
@97858   = ~What do you mean?~
@97859   = ~Gerwulf had that obsession with turning monsters into allies. Ankhegs, lycanthropes, myconids.~
@97860   = ~He put his life and those around him in constant danger. All for his foolishness.~
@97861   = ~Foolishness? A-Alendir, I won't let you speak of my father like that!~
@97862   = ~Why? He was just a mere human. Unable to see beyond his own arrogance. His weakness led to the downfall of that little village.~
@97863   = ~There's no need for primitive rage, <PRO_RACE>.~
@97864   = ~*sigh* I'm sorry, little Caraneth. I've... gone too far, it's true.~
@97865   = ~Why, Alendir? Why do you hate my father?~
@97866   = ~What happened between your father and me is none of your concern!~
@97867   = ~We have more urgent matters to attend to. Gemystara can be found after my ritual.~
@97868   = ~It will take me some time to get a result. In the meantime, don't bother me. Come back after a reasonable time, Caraneth.~
@97869   = ~Good work, spawn of Bhaal. The fang will be more than enough for the ritual. As for the scales, I can use them to imbue an old shield from my arsenal.~ ~Good work, daughter of Bhaal. The fang will be more than enough for the ritual. As for the scales, I can use them to imbue an old shield from my arsenal.~
@97870   = ~The result is this shield, <PRO_RACE>. Don't let its appearance deceive you. Its defenses are as tough as dragon scales. Additionally, it will make the bearer immune to petrification.~
@97871   = ~It wasn't easy, Alendir... though... though I would have preferred not to have to kill it.~
@97872   = ~<CHARNAME> made the decision... and I understand that finding my mother is a priority... But I can't help but think there was another way.~
@97873   = ~I've told you not to bother me. I need full concentration to perform my ritual. Now, be gone!~
@97874   = ~*Alendir is in a trance. Apparently, nothing and no one can interrupt him. Perhaps Fall can do something about it.*~
@97875   = ~C-Caraneth?! No... How did you get here?~


@97876   = ~Don't underestimate me, Alendir... I've come this far seeking answers!~
@97877   = ~*meow* With a little help, don't you think?~
@97878   = ~N-no... you weren't supposed to be here! You must leave before... Oh no... it's too late...~
@97879   = ~Little Caraneth... you shouldn't have come here. Your mother... your mother should not be rescued.~
@97880  = ~Not Fall, Icelock. We won't harm her!~
@97881  = ~I...~
@97882  = ~Alendir, what will it be then? I won't hold back if you decide to attack us.~
@97883  = ~I knew you were a coward, elf. I will show you no mercy. You will die!~
@97884  = ~Alendir, you don't have to do this. I know that somewhere in your cold heart you care for Fall enough not to give in to your ambitions. Help us.~
@97885  = ~I have no other choice, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry. Truly.~
@97886  = ~I am the Frostmaster! Your paths ends here...~
@97887  = ~<CHARNAME>... Fall...~
@97888  = ~No, Icelock... You are the one who is finished!~
@97889  = ~Alendir... please... don't do this to us...~
@97890  = ~There is more at stake than our lives, little Caraneth.~
@97891  = ~I hope you can understand it someday.~
@97892  = ~Don't worry. I'll revive you when this is over.~
@97893  = ~No! If my friends fall with me, so be it. If you bring me back, I will kill you with my own hands!~
@97894  = ~You will try, Caraneth. You will try...~
@97895  = ~There is no place for the weak, Alendir. But you have been useful so far. I'll make sure her body does not suffer irreparable damage. Later, you can revive her.~
@97896  = ~But the rest will die. Irreparably.~
@97897  = ~*coughs* C-caraneth... *You observe Alendir's wounds and realize he doesn't have much time left*~
@97898  = ~*whispers* Caraneth...~
@97899  = ~Alendir, you got what you deserved. You shouldn't have allied yourself with an interplanar monster. You have been a fool.~
@978100 = ~You don't have much time left, elf. You better save your strength if you want to survive.~
@978101 = ~Death is what I deserve and death will be *coughs* welcome.~
@978102 = ~W-where is Fall? I need... I need to talk to her.~
@978103 = ~She can't speak right now. And even if she could, she wouldn't allow herself to speak to scum like you.~
@978104 = ~She can't speak right now. I'm sorry to say she is dead.~
@978105 = ~She can't speak right now. She's not available at the moment.~
@978106 = ~Spawn of Bhaal... your reputation... precedes you...~
@978107 = ~If she is dead... revive her, <CHARNAME>. I will use all my strength to stay alive until... until I can speak with her.~
@978109 = ~You have been foolish, Alendir. You shouldn't have attacked Icelock alone.~
@978110 = ~*smiles* Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I never... *coughs* never should have allied myself with that creature...~
@978111 = ~*smiles* I expected no less from <CHARNAME>. At least... Icelock has been destroyed.~
@978112 = ~N-no, Caraneth. My days have come to an end. It's... what I deserve.~
@978113 = ~N-no, Caraneth. <CHARNAME> is right. This is what I deserve. I've finally reaped what I have sown...~
@978114 = ~My imminent death is inconsequential. You must hear what I have to tell you.~
@978115 = ~Gemystara... Gerwulf... forgive me, please...~
@978116 = ~Your mother... is in the Abyss.~
@978117 = ~W-what?!~
@978118 = ~It's the truth, little Caraneth. In the Abyss... or at least in one of its layers.~
@978119 = ~The Abyss harbors countless horrors and is divided into infinite layers of evil.~
@978120 = ~Demonic creatures constantly attempt to invade the outer planes. For their conquest. For their destruction.~
@978121 = ~*coughs* Gemystara discovered that the one responsible for the attack on Imnescar is a powerful creature named Morgrath.~
@978122 = ~Morgrath seeks at all costs to invade the Material Plane and expand his Shyntquarra.~
@978123 = ~That word... the golem mentioned it.~
@978124 = ~Indeed. Icelock... was the minion of Cryonax, the lord of the Elemental Plane of Ice.~
@978125 = ~Cryonax also seeks to conquer this land, which is why he wanted to prevent the Shyntquarra.~
@978126 = ~But that ended with Icelock's destruction. You've avoided Cryonax's direct intervention.~
@978127 = ~But Morgrath remains.~
@978128 = ~Morgrath... means "The Legion that Cannot be Seen". It is an entity that commands countless evil creatures.~
@978129 = ~A demonic swarm... with a hive-minded demon.~
@978130 = ~Its influence poisons everything it touches. That's why your mother couldn't use her magic in Imnescar.~
@978131 = ~But that... that has changed.~
@978132 = ~What do you mean, Alendir?~
@978133 = ~*coughs* I think your mother has discovered a way to stop Morgrath.~
@978134 = ~That's why she has gone to the Abyss. To that spider-like layer called Rachnidra.~
@978135 = ~I knew... I knew you would come, little Caraneth. Although I didn't expect it to be so soon.~
@978136 = ~I know how to get to Rachnidra. I've imbued one of my possessions to open the portal to the Abyss.~
@978137 = ~*sigh* But it requires great power to execute it.~
@978138 = ~I can do it, Alendir. I can open that portal and go after my mother.~
@978139 = ~It's not up to you, Fall. The Ice Rose will decide when the time is right.~
@978140 = ~Carry it with you always, little one.~
@978141 = ~I... I... *his eyes slowly close*~
@978142 = ~Alendir? Alendir, don't die. Please...~


// VER

@978143 = ~*coughs* I don't have... much time left...~
@978144 = ~So be it. I'll bring her back as soon as possible. Hang on, Alendir.~
@978145 = ~Hurry, <CHARNAME>. Before... it's too late.~

@978146 = ~You have been brave, Alendir. Icelock has been destroyed.~


// Dusk
@9784000   = ~*sigh* Nothing good can come from a wizard and his plans.~

// P_BFALL y P_BFAL25
// Aerie

@9790    = ~Aerie, I've noticed for some time now that you've been trying to strike up a conversation with me. Feel free to talk to me, my dear friend.~
@9791    = ~Fall! Y-you... yes, that's true.~
@9792    = ~So? What's going on? You can talk to me about anything.~
@9793    = ~W-well, Fall... I don't want you to think badly of me. Because of having been in the circus.~
@9794    = ~What do you mean?~
@9795    = ~What you've done for the animals. It's been a noble act.~
@9796    = ~I understand. Don't you think it might have negatively affected your uncle Quayle's business?~
@9797    = ~No, Fall. Quayle is against cages too. I'm sure he would have done something about it on his own. But then Kalah happened.~
@9798    = ~That's true. But it's better to take matters into your own hands when you see injustice, don't you think?~
@9799    = ~Y-yes, you're right!~
@97910   = ~I'm glad we think the same, Aerie. The fact that you were in the circus doesn't make me think badly of you.~
@97911   = ~Your heart is in the right place... and that's enough for you to earn my respect.~
@97912   = ~Thank you, Fall. I'm glad to know I can count on you.~

@97913   = ~The warriors of the Order are very different from the astral explorers.~
@97914   = ~Why do you say that, Fall? Helm has many brave soldiers in his ranks. I imagine your homeland's explorers must envy us.~
@97915   = ~Hm... I'm not so sure. I've seen you fight. And I've seen my father fight. There's nothing for you to envy.~
@97916   = ~I'm sorry if what I said offended you, milady. I'm sure your father was a great warrior.~
@97917   = ~He was, Anomen. His skill with the crossbow was commendable. I had the honor of learning the art of war from him.~
@97918   = ~Your training has paid off.~
@97919   = ~Coming from you, that's quite a compliment. Thank you, Anomen.~

@97920   = ~Fall, your appreciation for animals is nothing short of inspiring if I may say so. You fight with the fierceness of a wolf protecting her pups.~
@97921   = ~We are all children of this land, Cernd. It's the least I can do. Even if I use the tools of a human.~
@97922   = ~I understand that you sometimes find yourself in a dichotomy regarding humans.~
@97923   = ~I have witnessed how man's hand is capable of creating... but also of destroying. Fire has the quality of saving and destroying. Such is man.~
@97924   = ~I have faced many poachers. Mostly humans. Their ambition is capable of consuming entire forests.~
@97925   = ~But, on the other hand, the person I admired most was a human. My father.~
@97926   = ~A powerful Beastmaster, I understand.~
@97927   = ~Yes. He found Daren and Sinna when they were still pups. It was... really painful to see him die.~
@97928   = ~I'm sorry you had to witness that. Nature can sometimes be very cruel, for it is wild like a tornado, but it can also be gentle like a zephyr.~
@97929   = ~Perhaps, Cernd... it might be better to leave the conversation for another time. Right now, the memory of my father stirs my heart.~
@97930   = ~So be it, Fall.~

// Edwin (male)

@97931  = ~I've seen you, Edwin! You've been eyeing my robe for a long time now. What are you up to?~
@97932  = ~Why does it bother you, half-elf? The fact that the eyes of Edwin Odesseiron are upon you should be, at the very least, flattering.~
@97933  = ~Flattering? You don't have the noble bearing you so desperately try to project, wizard. I know your intentions are always shady.~
@97934  = ~(What is this girl talking about?) Hmph, I have no strange intentions towards you, woman. You may have a certain charm, but it's your robe that has truly caught my attention.~
@97935  = ~And what about it?~
@97936  = ~Come on... it's craftsmanship of the High Elves, isn't it? You wield arcane power, despite acting like a tin-headed fool all the time.~
@97937  = ~Or maybe I just imagine you without it, you know? (Yes, even a half-elf can be attractive to the great Edwin Odesseiron).~
@97938  = ~You know that as a half-elf I can hear you muttering, right?~
@97939  = ~W-what? (Hmph, one can't even think in peace) Anyway, woman, you don't attract me. I wouldn't deign to be with someone of... tainted blood.~
@97940  = ~Really? Well, that's a relief. Now, keep your eyes off my robe, will you?~

// Haer-Dalis

@97941  = ~Ah, but if it isn't the beloved songbird. Do you need the good Haer-Dalis to dedicate a song to you?~
@97942  = ~Hm... no, tiefling. Actually, you're the one who approached me. Do you need something?~
@97943  = ~Well, I've noticed that you sometimes emanate an aura of sadness. Like now. There's nothing like a good poem to lift the spirits!~
@97944  = ~I appreciate it, Haer-Dalis... but I'm fine. I don't need--~
@97945  = ~In sadness, the red bird flies, But the good tiefling reveals his song, Melodies that emerge from the heart, An echo of love, of art and devotion.~
@97946  = ~Ah, I see you had this composed beforehand. It's not neces--~
@97947  = ~Its notes whisper a hidden mystery, A song of souls seeking turmoil, In each verse, its essence rises, Transforming pain into pure presence.~
@97948  = ~Why so much emphasis on sadness? I'm not feel--~
@97949  = ~The red bird, symbol of sorrow, Finds solace in this uplifting song, The skillful tiefling, his voice unfolds, A gift of music, magic he bestows.~
@97950  = ~Well, that was beautif--~
@97951  = ~Thus, in sadness, poetry blooms, The art that soothes and guides the soul, The red bird denotes sadness, But the good tiefling composes beauty.~
@97952  = ~*remains silent*~
@97953  = ~So, what did you think of my song, songbird?~
@97954  = ~(Oh, it's finally over) Well, it was beautiful, Haer-Dalis!~
@97955  = ~I can sing you another if you want.~
@97956  = ~Oh, no! Look at the time... it's time for me to train with my crossbow. Maybe next time, okay? Goodbye!~
@97957  = ~Of course! Fly high, little songbird.~

// Imoen

@97958  = ~Imoen, have you ever been to Imnescar? You know, it's famous for its fruit orchards.~
@97959  = ~No, I haven't been to Imnescar. In fact, my travels are limited to the places I've gone with <CHARNAME>.~
@97960  = ~Would you like to go someday? I think we could make a good travel group with you, me, Daren, and Sinna. What do you think?~
@97961  = ~That sounds nice, Fall. I like your pups. Sinna is very sweet and energetic.~
@97962  = ~What about Daren?~
@97963  = ~Oh... hmm, he makes me a little nervous, to be honest. His gaze is piercing. It feels like he's going to eat your legs at any moment, you know?~
@97964  = ~Ha! Don't be fooled. Daren is a sweet wolf. You just need to pet his back for a few moments, and you'll win his heart.~
@97965  = ~Well... I think I prefer Sinna. No offense!~
@97966  = ~Don't worry. I'm sure that with time, you'll get along with Daren. You two aren't so different, you know?~

// Jaheira

@97967  = ~You would have made a good Harper, Fall. It's a shame I didn't meet you sooner.~
@97968  = ~A Harper? I've heard of them, but I'm not sure what they do.~
@97969  = ~The Harpers are responsible for maintaining the balance between Nature and Civilization. Whenever there's a major event in the world, they are there, ensuring it doesn't lead to chaos and that general knowledge isn't lost.~
@97970  = ~I see. A kind of organization that preserves memory. It's... interesting. Although, to be honest, I prefer to return to the forests as soon as I finish my business in Amn.~
@97971  = ~I understand, dear. Nature is alluring to those who are like us. I think... that even I would do the same.~
@97972  = ~And what holds you back, Jaheira?~
@97973  = ~Well... I suppose the same thing that holds you back, Fall. Unfinished business. Irenicus, <CHARNAME>. There's still much work to be done.~
@97974  = ~That's true. I guess we'll know when we get there, don't you think?~
@97975  = ~That's true, Fall. That's true...~

// Jan 

@97976  = ~I'm telling you, Fall. The turnips from the Jansen harvest are as delicious as those fruits you describe from Imnescar.~
@97977  = ~That's possible, Jan. However, I don't think there's as big a trade for turnips as there is for fruits in the south of Amn. You see, I had a cousin... well, he wasn't really a cousin, he was Moco Manzana, everyone's cousin. He was a halfling rogue who liked to steal melon seeds to use in his alcoholic experiments in his quest to create a super sweet drink that would intoxicate anyone with just its aroma.~
@97978  = ~I understand. Golodon wanted to do something similar with--~
@97979  = ~The thing is, Moco somehow managed to create such a drink. But he didn't get the desired result. His pony drank from the preliminary brew he had created and went mad. It gained strength similar to that of a bull, you know? Or maybe that of a griffin. Hm, sorry to mention griffins, you know? I know you haven't had a good experience with them.~
@97980  = ~Well, that's true. Once a griffin--~
@97981  = ~Anyway, the thing is, this pony, which was named Big Dulon. Did I mention his name was Big Dulon? It's a pun, you know? Grandulon! It's very funny if you think about it. Anyway, the thing is, Big Dulon went into a frenzy and started devouring all the grass in sight, trying to relieve the sweet taste it had gained from Moco's drink.~
@97982  = ~Yes. That reminds me of--~
@97983  = ~It took us three whole weeks of grass trafficking from the Mir Woods to calm him down. I was very young at the time, but I remember it clearly. That year, we lost many pounds of pears and lemons in compensation to the inhabitants of Mir to stop them from giving us dirty looks due to Big Dulon's excessive consumption of their grass. It was total chaos, you know?~
@97984  = ~Ehm... I think it's time for me to get to work on... ehm, one of my inventions, okay, Fall?~
@97985  = ~Oh, don't you want to hear how the story continues, Jan? I assure you it's entertaining.~
@97986  = ~Hm... no, I think I've had enough, thanks.~
@97987  = ~*sigh* (So this is how it feels, huh?)~

// Keldorn

@97988  = ~Fall, how are you? I've noticed you've been quite hesitant lately.~
@97989  = ~Sir Keldorn, have you ever thought about what lies beyond our mortal existence?~
@97990  = ~A question that has gnawed at many. However, I'll tell you what I believe: as a paladin, I believe in the eternal reward of faithfully serving Torm.~
@97991  = ~It must be comforting to have that conviction. As for me, I find solace in the cycles of nature and the interconnectedness of all living beings.~
@97992  = ~Indeed, the beauty of creation is undeniable. We may differ in our beliefs, but there is wisdom in both perspectives.~
@97993  = ~I appreciate your words, my lord.~
@97994  = ~It is always a pleasure, Fall.~

// Korgan

@97995  = ~*whisper* Good job, Daren. Good job, Sinna.~
@97996  = ~Fall, why do you waste your time with beasts and creatures? A true warrior seeks glory in battle, not in the company of furry critters.~
@97997  = ~Korgan, animals are part of the intricate web of life. They are loyal allies and companions. They deserve our respect and protection.~
@97998  = ~Bah! I'll stick with my bloody axe and a mug of ale. I don't need cuddly companions or the whims of nature.~
@97999  = ~Why do you have such disdain for animals? They possess a purity and loyalty that is often lacking in the hearts of men.~
@979100 = ~Animals, you say? Hmph! They're nothing but mindless creatures, driven by instinct and survival.~
@979101 = ~Animals are not mere beasts. They possess an innate wisdom, attuned to the rhythms of nature. They teach us about harmony and adaptability.~
@979102 = ~*grumble*... Wisdom? Ha! I prefer the straightforward path of steel and blood. Nature's teachings won't protect me when the enemies close in.~

// Mazzy

@979103 = ~Mazzy, your skills with the short bow are impressive. I'm glad to have someone brave and righteous as a battle companion.~
@979104 = ~Thank you, Fall. I also admire your prowess with the crossbow and how you care for your wolves. Animals are a special part of nature, and we must protect them.~
@979105 = ~The forests are our home, and we must preserve them. Have you ever felt a deep connection with nature during your travels?~
@979106 = ~Yes, there's a peace and serenity I find in nature. It helps me remember the purpose of my duty as Arvoreen's Sword: to protect the innocent and preserve harmony.~
@979107 = ~Good words, dear friend. Your conviction only strengthens mine.~
@979108 = ~I believe our faith is what keeps us firm in our purpose, Fall. Come, let's continue.~

// Minsc

@979109 = ~I love your enthusiasm, Minsc. You're always ready to face danger with courage. And Boo, that hamster of yours, always has good advice, doesn't he?~
@979110 = ~That's right, Fall! Boo is my trusted companion, the wisest of all hamsters. Sometimes he whispers in my ear and tells me what to do. He's my furry guide!~
@979111 = ~That connection you have with Boo is unique, Minsc. It always makes me smile to see you two interact.~
@979112 = ~Oh, Fall, you have no idea of the adventures we've had! Together we've faced giant spiders, werewolves, and all sorts of monsters! We are invincible!~
@979113 = ~Impressive. Let's move forward, brave explorers, in search of new adventures!~
@979114 = ~Yes! Minsc and Boo are ready! *squeak*~


// Nalia

@979115 = ~Fall, I've been wondering about your animal companions, Daren and Sinna. How do you summon them? At first glance, they seem like conjuration spells.~
@979116 = ~Ah, Nalia, my loyal wolves, Daren and Sinna, are more than just four-legged companions to me. They are part of my spirit and my connection with nature. Through summoning magic, I can call them to my side and share our strength and courage in battle. My father found them when they were just pups.~
@979117 = ~Fascinating. I wonder if this special connection with animals is something that can be learned or if it is an innate gift. What do you think about it?~
@979118 = ~I believe we all have the capacity to connect with animals, but some possess a deeper and more natural bond. For me, it has been a combination of study, practice, and love for nature. Thanks to my mother, I've dedicated time and effort to understanding their language and behavior, which has strengthened our bond and allowed me to develop this innate ability.~
@979119 = ~An extraordinary gift, Fall. I would have liked... to meet your mother. I've heard that the selu'taar are among the most powerful arcane users in all of Faerûn.~
@979120 = ~I think you would get along well with her, Nalia. I hope... I hope you get the chance to meet her. I hope... I hope I can find her.~
@979121 = ~I hope the same, dear friend. Rest assured, you have my support in your quest.~
@979122 = ~Thank you, Nalia. Truly.~

// Valygar

@979123 = ~Fall, I have a question that's been on my mind. Your mother is a powerful elven sorceress, right? I wonder how you feel about magic, considering your lineage and family ties.~
@979124 = ~What do you mean, Valygar? I sense... there's something you're hesitant to say for fear of being... offensive?~
@979125 = ~I... apologize, Fall. I know your mother is missing... but, don't you think it's because she wanted it that way? Magic... is a complex matter. And I see that you stay away from those kinds of tricks.~
@979126 = ~Tricks? I-I see, Valygar. I... admit that I've thought about it.~
@979127 = ~I'm not entirely sure about the innate corruption in arcane magic. Though I've seen firsthand what some wayward wizards are capable of.~
@979128 = ~But I don't believe that's the case with my mother. No... she is kind. She loves nature. She loved my father, who was human. No, I can't accept that she's been corrupted by magic, Valygar. Just because something like that happened to you doesn't mean it's destined for everyone.~
@979129 = ~You're right, Fall. I'm sorry if I offended you with my insinuations. Magic is... a complicated topic for me.~
@979130 = ~I want you to know that I'll do my best to stand by your side in your personal quest, Fall.~
@979131 = ~Thank you, Valygar. You're a good man.~

// Viconia

@979132 = ~Viconia... I've noticed you have no love for Lolth. I think-~
@979133 = ~I know where you're going with this, tu'rilthiir. You want to find common ground between us. And no, I have no sympathy for spiders.~
@979134 = ~I see, well I-~
@979135 = ~That doesn't mean we're allies in anything, ligrr. I don't pity your cause, nor do I have any obligation to join it.~
@979136 = ~I'm not looking to change your beliefs or demand your loyalty, Viconia.~
@979137 = ~We'll see if your words hold up in practice.~
@979138 = ~We shall see...~

// Yoshimo

@979139 = ~Why do you shy away from my wolves whenever they're around us, Yoshimo? I assure you, they're harmless.~
@979140 = ~Oh, Fall. It's not that Yoshimo is afraid of them. And as for "harmless," well... let's just say I've seen what they do to those you command them to attack.~
@979141 = ~Ha! Don't the warriors of Kara-Tur kill? My wolves and I fight for a just cause. Combat is sometimes inevitable.~
@979142 = ~We agree on that, dear Fall. However, that doesn't mean I want to be around your... "pups" all the time.~
@979143 = ~Come on, Yoshimo! You'll see how good they are if you just pet them a little. Hmm, well, I suppose petting wolves isn't for everyone.~

// Sarevok

@979144 = ~Why do you stare at me so much, girl? If I were you, I'd be more careful where you set your eyes.~
@979145 = ~Oh, I'm sorry, Sarevok. It's just that... I can't believe you're <CHARNAME>'s brother.~
@979146 = ~We come from the same father. Though I no longer carry Bhaal's essence, the same blood runs through <CHARNAME>'s veins as it does through mine.~
@979147 = ~You must hate your father, don't you?~
@979148 = ~Hate? I don't believe in such nonsense, child. The time one wastes on trivial feelings is time one can never get back.~
@979149 = ~And time... is of the essence.~
@979150 = ~On that, we agree. Well, after all, there is something of <CHARNAME> in you.~
@979151 = ~Hmpf. You better stop talking to me, will you? There's work to be done.~

// MISIÓN 1

@210001 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

After a brief conversation with Dusk, he mentioned the possibility of retrieving his combat armor, a chainmail vest that was handed over to an elf named Mathyus for repairs. We can find him in his hideout at the Docks, near the lair of the Thieves.~

@210003 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

We found Mathyus Davis, a strange elf with green hair. Our encounter led to another quest: the search of a Leprechaun named Michelson.
According to Mathyus, the little one would be wandering the streets of the port. We can recognize him by his red hair and green clothing.
Lastly, convincing him to return won't be easy. We'll have to use gold, beer... or make him laugh with a joke.
We'll see how the quest turns out.~

@210004 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

Finally, we found Michelson and were able to convince him to return with Mathyus. We should go back and claim our reward.~


@210005 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

We returned to Mathyus Davis' hideout and found Michelson by his side. After a brief conversation in which he told us about his first encounter with Michelson and his subsequent hair color change, Mathyus handed over the Shilmist Armor to Dusk.
He also gave us a book of formulas for forging powerful artifacts, provided by Michelson. If we can get the right ingredients, we should talk to Mathyus so we can forge the artifact described in the book.~

// MISIÓN 2

@210006 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We came across a curious dog named Demolisher. It turned out to be Mathyus Davis' animal companion. He brought a note intended for Dusk, which indicated that there was expected news about the Cormyr detachment. It probably has to do with Dusk's old companions, but to find out, we'll have to head to the Athkatla's Docks, towards Mathyus' hideout.~

@210007 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We returned to Mathyus Davis' hideout as Demolisher's note indicated. It was the location of the tribe that attacked Dusk's detachment when they were flanking Troll Hill. According to the elf, the tribe consists of humanoids in the Windspear Hills, located southeast of the region, near a large lake. However, Michelson warned that it was possible that it was not the original party that attacked Dusk. I guess we'll see when we find that tribe.~

@210008 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We found the tribe of humanoids who were apparently responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment. For some reason, they insisted that they were innocent, but we found that they carried a purple broken shield with the emblem of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr. Dusk didn't hesitate and attacked them.~

@210009 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has managed to resolve the conflict without bloodshed. Although he couldn't decipher the mystery of the Cormyr shield, he has recovered it and is now campaigning to give a home to the renegades of Sothillis. We must go to the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart in the Temple District of Athkatla and talk to Sir Ryan Trawl. Dusk believes he can provide a solution to the matter.~

@210010 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk and I have dealt with the renegades of Sothillis. However, it seemed to be a trap orchestrated by an Enchanter named Sornhil. He seemed to know Dusk's identity, as well as my divine lineage. He said that Dusk had passed a test and gave him an orb, which we should take to Mathyus for analysis.~

@210011 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has spoken to Sir Ryan Trawl about the matter of the renegades of Sothillis. However, before helping him, he intends to resolve the existing conflict with the fallen paladins and slave trafficking in Athkatla. Once the issue is resolved, we should return to Trawl to finish the matter with the humanoids.~

@210012 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Sir Ryan Trawl has promised to intervene with the prelate regarding the issue of the Sothillis renegades. All that remains is to deliver the good news to the humanoids in the Windspear Hills.~

@210013 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We have delivered the good news to Falon and his tribe. They were very pleased with the outcome and I believe Dusk was too. If things had turned out differently, our Wizard Slayer might be a completely different person.~

@210014 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Out of nowhere, a mysterious enchanter appeared to us. It was Sornhil, and he seemed to be aware of Dusk's identity, as well as my divine lineage. He said that Dusk had disappointed him by forgiving the renegades of Sothillis, and that this would lead to an inevitable conflict. He also gave Dusk an orb, which we should take to Mathyus for analysis.~

@210015 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has taken the orb to Mathyus and Michelson. With their help, he was able to decipher how to unleash its inner power. Despite his friends' warnings, Dusk used the orb and as a consequence, he has undergone a drastic change. Whether this is something good, only time will tell.~

@210016 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk took the orb to Mathyus and Michelson. With their help, he was able to decipher how to unleash its inner power. However, he followed his friends' advice and chose to purify it before using it. While the weakened version of the orb had less of an effect, it seems to have affected our companion in both attitude and judgment. Perhaps it's a drastic change, but it may be for the better. Only time will tell.~

// MISSION 3

@210017 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

Demolisher appeared with a note from Mathyus Davis. Apparently, he has located the tribe of humanoids responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment. Our warrior from Cormyr is certain that this is the correct target. We will gather more information when we go to the Port District, towards the hideout of the green-haired elf.~

@210019 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We arrived at Mathyus' hideout and he informed us that the clan responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment is located near the Druidic Grove of the region. According to the report provided by the scout, the culprit is an orc chieftain named Alabarza. We will find him in the Troll Mound to the west of the region. Mathyus also informed us that the orc has a varied repertoire of monsters ready to defend him.~

@210020 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

During the journey to the Troll Mound, another mage intercepted us. This time, it was Valatar, the Conjurer. At first, he pretended to seek gratitude from Dusk for increasing his power through the scarlet orb. However, Dusk threatened him with death, so the Conjurer called upon a powerful abyssal demon to eliminate us.~

@210021 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We were able to kill the abyssal demon summoned by Valatar. Dusk felt a strange call from his crimson sword. He ended up finishing off the heart of the beast, and the weapon has improved, gaining new powers.~

@210022 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

During our journey to the Troll Mound, another mage intercepted us. This time, it was Valatar, the Conjurer. After a brief exchange of words in which Valatar declared the power that Dusk wasted by rejecting the scarlet orb, he decided to send an abyssal demon to kill us.~

@210023 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We were able to kill the abyssal demon summoned by Valatar. Dusk felt a strange calling from his emerald sword. He ended up striking the heart of the beast, banishing it forever from this plane. The weapon, apparently, has slightly improved.~

@210024 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We found Alabarza's lair. However, we fell into a trap, where several minion monsters of the Orc Chieftain appeared. His yuan-ti mentioned a mysterious elven mage who gave him a transmutation spell to his chieftain, with which he was able to lure us. If we survive the fight, Dusk is likely to be interested in this information.~

@210025 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

Finally, we have defeated Alabarza the Mutilator, along with his powerful minions. We should go and report the news to Mathyus, back in the Athkatla's Docks.~

@210026 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We arrived at Mathyus' lair, and he informed us that the clan responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment is located near the Druidic Grove in the region. According to the report provided by the scout, the responsible party is an orc chieftain named Alabarza. We will find him at the Troll Mound to the west of the region. He also informed us that the orc has a varied repertoire of monsters ready to defend him. Fortunately, Dusk will have the help of Sir Ryan Trawl and Falon and his tribe. When the time comes, a activation gem provided by Michelson will bring them to the confrontation.~

@210027 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have defeated Alabarza and his clan with the help of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Michelson appeared to perform a purification ritual at the Troll Mound. The ritual includes the resurrection of fallen warriors who were summoned by the Teleportation Orb. After we spoke with the leprechaun, we were transported back to Athkatla.~

@210028 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have defeated Alabarza and his clan with the help of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Michelson appeared to perform a purification ritual at the Troll Mound. The ritual includes the resurrection of fallen warriors who were summoned by the Teleportation Orb. After we spoke with the leprechaun, we were transported back to Athkatla.~

//RESOLUCION M3

@210029 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of the victory over the Alabarza clan, but also conveyed Dusk's fall in battle. Mathyus and Michelson were saddened, but also relieved. They believed that Dusk had taken a dark path from which he would not be able to return. I suppose that will now be in the past, as at least Dusk's revenge has been fulfilled, even if it meant his death.~

@210030 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of the victory over the Alabarza clan, but also conveyed Dusk's fall in battle. Mathyus and Michelson were saddened. They tried to convince themselves that the battle at least brought justice for the fallen of Cormyr, but I know that it is only a small consolation. Mathyus and his company will return to Shilmista, not without wishing us fortune and health for our travels.~

@210031 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of our victory against the Alabarza clan. Dusk mentioned feeling like there was something more behind Alabarza's attack on their detachment. Mathyus and his companions assured Dusk that they would investigate further if that was the case. In the meantime, we have a good amount of gold as a reward, something that will be useful in the battles to come...~

@210032 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of our victory against the Alabarza clan. We have received a good reward from Dusk's Shilmist allies. Dusk mentioned that Alabarza and his clan were used in the attack against the Cormyr detachment by the mysterious Order of Mages, composed of Sornhil and Valatar, whom we encountered. The orc chieftain also mentioned an elf named Kalanda and the leader of the Order, a necromancer of whom we know nothing. Something tells me that it won't be the last time we hear about them.~

@210033 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We returned to Mathyus' hideout in the Athkatla's Docks. I gave the floor to Dusk to deliver the news of our victory over the Alabarza clan, but to my surprise, he ended up killing Mathyus, Demolisher, and Michelson, using a power that I assume came from the mysterious scarlet orb he absorbed some time ago.~

@210034 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

After the surprising murder of the inhabitants of Shilmista, a shadowy demon appeared in the compound: Danctian Shadow. The creature indicated that it comes from Pandemonium and its origin derives from the Scarlet Orb that Sornhil knew how to deliver to Dusk. For some time, it had been whispering a plan into the Cormyrean's ear, which it revealed to us recently. The liberation of the demon and the murder of the Shilmistas. Now, we have the alliance of Danctian for a future confrontation against the mysterious Order of Mages that is pursuing Dusk. Only time will tell if our Wizard Slayer's decision was the right one.~

@210035 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Dusk has recounted the events that led him to become the Wizard Slayer. Apparently, a necromancer named Anthagar was responsible for casting a curse that ended up consuming the life of his wife, Celine. Although Dusk did everything possible to try to save his wife, he failed in his endeavor. He only has the hope of finding Anthagar and his Order someday.~

@210036 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We crossed paths with Kalanda, the Transmuter, in BrynnLaw. Apparently, he was waiting for us to put us to the test, summoning a couple of weak creatures before transmuting them into bloodthirsty monsters. What do these mages want with Dusk and me? We still don't know. But I have a feeling that it won't be the last time we hear from them.~

@210037 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have finally met the one behind all the arcane attacks on Dusk and our party: Anthagar, the Necromancer. He claims to be the leader of an order of magi called the Forgotten Crypt, a sinister cult dedicated to the demigod Velsharoon, the Lord of Undeath. We still don't know what his ultimate scheme is with us. For now, we must overcome the obstacles he puts in our way once again.~

@210038 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have finally met the one behind all the arcane attacks on Dusk and our party: Anthagar, the Necromancer. He claims to be the leader of an order of magi called the Forgotten Crypt, a sinister cult dedicated to the demigod Velsharoon, the Lord of Undeath. We still don't know what his ultimate scheme is. For now, we must survive the fateful encounter he has prepared for us, as he sees us as a threat to his future plans.~

@210039 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Danctian has appeared from the shadows to contact us. He says he has something to offer us that will benefit the party and is related to the order of the mages of the Forgotten Crypt. Without a doubt, this is directly related to the appearance of Anthagar and the other sorcerers. For more information, we must go to the abandoned house northwest of Athkatla's Docks.~

@210040 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Demolisher has appeared to contact us, bringing with him a note written by Mathyus Davis. Dusk read it, informing us of Anthagar's appearance in Athkatla. Apparently, he delivered a mysterious stone, possibly for teleportation, to our Shilmist friends. We must go to the Athkatla's Docks to Mathyus and Michelson's lair for more information.~

@210041 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have reached Mathyus' hideout and he has updated us on the current situation. Indeed, the orb that Anthagar delivered to Mathyus and Michelson is in the hands of the shilmists and serves as a bridge to the final confrontation location. We will have the help of Mathyus and Demolisher. We just have to talk to the elf when we're ready to leave.~

@210045 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Anthagar's accursed orb has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we're in any known location of the material plane, but rather in some sort of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We have no sign of Mathyus or Demolisher. I hope they arrive in time for the battle.~

@210043 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have arrived at Danctian's hideout. He informed us that Anthagar, the Necromancer, has made contact with him. The strange thing is that Dusk seemed to be aware of this. They may be communicating from a distance, as they seem to be connected in some way. In any case, he has informed us that the Forgotten Crypt plans a massacre in Faerûn in order to gain immortality. But they require me and Dusk to accomplish this. When we are ready for such a encounter, we need only speak to Danctian and ask him to take us there.~

@210044 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The accursed orb of Anthagar has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we are in any known location of the material plane, but rather in some kind of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We should explore a bit, but not without preparing for any eventuality...~

@210045 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The dark orb of Anthagar has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we are in any known place on the material plane, but rather in some kind of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We have no signs of Mathyus or Demolisher. I hope they arrive in time for the battle.~


// FINAL MISSION GOOD PATH
@210046 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. In the process, we had to face Mathyus, who had been enchanted by the Order of Magi of Anthagar. We had no other choice but to kill him, along with the rest of the Order. However, at the end of the battle, after retrieving the Symbol of Velsharoon and the body of the Shilmist elf, Michelson appeared. The leprechaun revived his friend and took us back to Athkatla. With Mathyus revived and everyone else safe, we were teleported to a kind of forest where Dusk could see his wife Celine for the last time.

Finally, back at Mathyus' lair, we were rewarded with gold and entrusted with the mission to defeat Irenicus and save the elves of Suldanessellar. In addition, we can always count on the guardians of Shilmista in case we want to forge any artifact from Michelson's list.~

@210047 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

However, after the battle and retrieving the Symbol of Velsharoon and the body of the Shilmist elf, Michelson appeared. The leprechaun revived his friend and took us back to Athkatla. Although Mathyus was revived, he realized that Dusk had fallen in battle. The Shilmists mourned the loss but were comforted by the fact that Velsharoon's allies fell into oblivion and their plans were foiled, something that Dusk would have wanted even at the cost of his own life. He mentioned that Celine was finally avenged and we were rewarded with gold, as well as entrusted with the mission to defeat Irenicus and save the elves of Suldanessellar. In addition, we can always count on the Shilmist guardians if we want to forge any artifact from Michelson's list.~

@210048 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. Dusk tricked Anthagar, making him believe he would ally with him to revive Velsharoon, the Demigod of Necromancy, also known as Mellifleur. The Order of Mages attacked fiercely and, while we managed to win, Dusk fell in combat.
Danctian, the shadow demon of Pandemonium, brought us back to Athkatla and left us a good amount of gold. After that, he bid farewell to our plane. I assume he has returned to the shadows where he belongs.~

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. Dusk tricked Anthagar, making him believe he would ally with him to revive Velsharoon, the Demigod of Necromancy, also known as Mellifleur. The Order of Mages attacked fiercely, but despite that, we managed to win.
After the victory, Danctian, the shadow demon of Pandemonium, took us to a strange wasteland where he was able to bring the spirit of Dusk's wife, Celine. There, they had one last conversation where the she-elf lamented the path her husband had taken. Dusk, despite trying to hide it, was quite shaken by her words. I am certain that this will affect his future, even if he is not aware of it.~

// JOURNAL ENTRIES FALL

@310001 = ~Fall: Caged Animals

Fall, a half-elf ranger, has joined us with the quest of freeing the circus animals from their cages. She insists on being present during the negotiations for their release, as it is very important to her. To do so, we need to speak with someone named Andrew Oliva, a man we'll have to bribe. We can find him near the snake cage in Waukeen's Promenade.~

@310002 = ~Fall: Caged Animals

We've spoken with Andrew Oliva, a circus employee willing to release the caged animals for the exorbitant sum of 7500 gold pieces. Once I gather that amount, I should return to him to settle the matter once and for all. Perhaps I could even persuade him to lower the price and save us a good amount of coins.~

@310003 = ~Fall: Caged Animals

I refused to pay gold for the release of the caged animals. This angered Fall, and she left the group. Well, at least I saved a good amount of gold.~

@310004 = ~Fall: Caged Animals

We've paid Andrew to release the circus animals as soon as possible. Although it seemed that Andrew was going to swindle us, when Fall mentioned someone named Alendir, he seemed to reconsider the deal and promised that within a day, the animals would no longer be in their cages but free in the southern forests of Amn. Everything turned out well, but I wonder: Who is Alendir?~

@310005 = ~Fall: Alendir's Ritual

After a brief conversation with Fall, she mentioned that it is time to meet Alendir. According to Fall, Alendir might have important information about the whereabouts of her mother. We can find the elf on the upper floor of the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District.~

@310006 = ~Fall: Alendir's Ritual

I've met Alendir, a Selu'taar elf from Evereska. He is an elderly man with a somewhat bitter personality, and surprisingly, he knew about my divine lineage. He has tasked us with seeking out a Greater Basilisk in the caves of the Umar Hills. Since the creature remains hidden, he has given us a strange orange gem that will lure the basilisk out of its hiding spot. We must eliminate any enemies we encounter there.~

@310007 = ~Fall: Alendir's Ritual

We've attacked the basilisk in the Umar caves. If we manage to defeat it, we should take whatever we can extract from its body and bring it to Alendir.~

@310008 = ~Fall: Alendir's Ritual

We encountered the Greater Basilisk in the Umar caves. Surprisingly, it was a kind basilisk that could speak, thanks to a magical amulet given to it by a druid many years ago. Voragor, as the basilisk is named, pulled out a fang from its powerful jaw and gave it to us. This should be more than enough for Alendir to perform his ritual.~

@310009 = ~Fall: Alendir's Ritual

We successfully delivered the necessary ingredient for Alendir to perform the ritual to locate Fall's mother, Gemystara. However, Fall and Alendir had a brief argument about Gerwulf, Fall's father. Apparently, he and Alendir had some sort of conflict in the past. For now, we've left Alendir to his thoughts. He has instructed us to return after a reasonable amount of time. I suppose Fall will know when that time is.~



@310010 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Fall believes it's time to return to Alendir to get answers about the whereabouts of her mother, Gemystara. The Lady of the Beasts has told us what little she knows about Alendir's past, and it seems the elf gained great power by becoming a Frostmaster, but at the cost of his elven youth. Fall also suspects his attitude towards her family, both his disdain for her father and his true intentions with her mother. For now, we must head to the upper floor of the Five Flagons in the Bridge District to meet him.~

@310011 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

We've returned to the Five Flagons Inn, but Alendir wasn't there. Instead, we found Kitochi, a faerie cat who was a battle companion of the rangers during the assault on Imnescar. Kitochi informed us that Alendir was able to perform the ritual, but what he discovered disturbed him greatly. As a result, Alendir withdrew to the sewers of the Slums, entering through the Copper Coronet tavern. In the sewers, Kitochi indicated that we could follow him by heading east through the passage where kobolds are often found. However, to proceed further, Kitochi told us that we would need a password to bypass the invisible wall there. The password is a phrase that says: "In the whisper of the icy wind, the path is found." After giving us the necessary information, Kitochi disappeared, but not before asking Fall not to summon him again, as I apparently insulted him too much.~

@310012 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

However, to proceed further, Kitochi told us that we would need a password to bypass the invisible wall there. The password is a phrase that says: "In the whisper of the icy wind, the path is found." After giving us the necessary information, Kitochi told Fall that he was now ready to be one of her summonings. He also said that I could speak to him if I wished. He might have something interesting to share.~

@310013 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Following the clues about Alendir, we've encountered a gigantic rhinoceros beetle. Strangely, it doesn't seem to be a hostile creature, but it also blocks the way to the next room. With no other ideas, Fall suggested summoning her special companions again and interacting with the giant creature. If that doesn't solve it, I'm afraid we'll have no choice but to attack it.~

@310014 = ~Fall: Tabitha, Warrior of Malar

Fall has managed to convince the Beastmaster to help us in the quest to free the slaves in the Copper Coronet. Apparently, the elf knew Fall's father when Imnescar fell. The friendship with her father was vital in winning his alliance. Ivor, as he said his name was, will seek out Fall once Lehtinan is dead.~

@310015 = ~Fall: Tabitha, Warrior of Malar

Ivor found us after learning of Lehtinan's death. He told us that the slavers of Athkatla have placed a bounty on his head due to his betrayal at the Copper Coronet. The Beastmaster fears for the life of his animal companion, Tabitha, so he sought out Fall to perform a ritual to send her to the Astral Plane to keep her safe. Fall has agreed and now carries a statuette of Malar, which she must study to send the leopard to the Astral Plane along with the rest of her summonings.~

@310016 = ~Fall: Tabitha, Warrior of Malar

Fall has told me that to complete Tabitha's ritual, she needs the armor of a powerful giant bear called Aeger. She believes the creature was the champion of the Blood God, Malar, and that by examining it, she will be able to send the leopard to the Astral Plane. We might be able to find it at the Adventurer's Mart in Waukeen's Promenade.~

@310017 = ~Fall: Tabitha, Warrior of Malar

We have obtained armor made from Aeger's hides. Fall will study it to progress in her ritual to send Tabitha to the Astral Plane. According to her, it shouldn't take long to unravel its mysteries.~

@310018 = ~Fall: Tabitha, Warrior of Malar

Fall has successfully sent Tabitha to the Astral Plane. From now on, the Lady of the Beasts should be able to summon her as one of her companions. Without a doubt, this could be a very useful special ability.~

@310019 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Fall has managed to resolve the issue with the giant beetle, an imposing creature named Kakuto. Thanks to her special summonings, the Lady of the Beasts was able to send Kakuto to the Astral Plane, though she had to sacrifice part of her vital energy to do so. Now, we have a clear path to follow Alendir.~

@310020 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

The giant beetle has been destroyed. Fall has expressed her regret, but also her determination to move forward and find Alendir. Now the path is clear; we should continue.~

@310021 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

We have reached Alendir's quarters, only to discover that it was a temple to the Prince of Ice, allied with a powerful Ice Golem named Icelock. Neither Fall nor I were able to convince him to ally with us. We have no other choice but to fight.~

@310022 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Unexpectedly, Alendir has betrayed Icelock and attacked him. It did not go well, and we have no choice but to fight. Alendir is still alive; perhaps we can still save him.~

@310023 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Alendir is dead. He left a note with instructions for Fall on how to reach the strange place where her mother is. Fall was not with us when Alendir passed away. Finally, we can put an end to the one who was once the Frostmaster.~

@310024 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

Alendir is on the brink of death. However, he said he would use all his strength to stay alive until he could speak with Fall. When Fall is safe and sound in our group, we can bring her to Alendir so they can speak one last time.~

@310025 = ~Fall: The Frostmaster

The Frostmaster is dead. Icelock has been destroyed. Alendir's last words to Fall were a confession. The Selu'taar elf told his little Caraneth how to activate the portal using an Ice Rose that was in his possession. However, the Rose will only activate when Fall is strong enough. I trust our crossbowwoman will know when that time comes. For now, we must continue our journey.~


@310026 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

Kitochi, the fey cat now accompanying Fall, has decided to tell me his story after I shared some of my origins. It seems he didn't always live in Imnescar but ended up in its forests while fleeing from an abyssal demon. Fortunately for the feline, he was rescued by a party of explorers and druids. Among them was his guardian-to-be: Aeris. Kitochi said he will continue the story as long as we summon him in any tavern in Athkatla.~

@310027 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

Kitochi continued his personal story, but after a while, he asked me for a favor: to take revenge on the killer of the druid who cared for him. I declined, and the matter has been closed. I'm not into feline scheming.~

@310028 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

Kitochi continued his personal story. After recounting his druid companion, Aeris, he asked for help with the creatures that killed him. Kitochi believes that we might not find the killer if we follow Fall's path and that it's better to deal with it before finishing the search for Gemystara. He mentioned that the creature might have a treasure, but if not, we could use its body to forge a powerful artifact. I wonder what kind of creature he's referring to. Lastly, to finalize the details of his feline revenge plan, we need to summon him in a forested area next time.~

@310029 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

Kitochi has finalized his plan. The target is Gorm, a giant insectoid creature with venomous traits. Apparently, it is an abyssal entity powerful enough to annihilate a veteran druid like Aeris, Kitochi's friend. The plan is to invade its abyssal plane, lure the beast, and kill it. To do this, we must go to the druid grove in the northwest and meet the druid Acrull Northshield. Acrull has a scale from Gorm that will link this plane to that of the worm. Kitochi said that Fall must be with us when talking to Acrull.~

@310030 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

We have met Acrull Northshield in the druid grove. He provided instructions on how to prepare for the confrontation with Gorm and its minions. Once we reach its lair, Fall must summon Kitochi to come to her call. When Gorm is defeated, we should take a part of its corpse so Acrull can open a portal to bring us back home. The druid recommended preparing before traveling to that plane.~

@310031 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

We have arrived at Gorm's lair, and the battle seems inevitable. Kitochi has instructed me that if we win, I must ensure that Fall stays alive. With her and Gorm's head in our possession, our return home will be secured.~

@310032 = ~Kitochi: For My Friend

Gorm is dead, and Kitochi's revenge for his friend Aeris has been completed. Acrull mentioned that we can sell the monster's head for a good sum of gold, although he also said it might be possible to forge something from it, though finding someone to do so might be more complicated than it seems.~


@310034 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We encountered a creature named Mesothel, a giant spider from the Abyss. It appears to have been one of the beings that led the attack on Imnescar and seemed to be waiting for Fall's arrival at the Spellhold. It doesn't seem to be related to the Hooded Mages or Bodhi. However, it seemed to be aware of my divine lineage. Unfortunately, we couldn't defeat her, and as a result, the creature escaped, prophesizing a future encounter. Her objectives are beyond my knowledge, and her sudden appearance has only disturbed Fall's mind.~

@310035 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

A projection of Alendir has appeared, indicating that the Ice Rose was about to melt, which would mean the portal to Rachnidra would open. However, he mentioned that this portal would only be a gateway to the Abyss and that there would be no turning back once crossing its threshold. I have declined to continue with this search due to the significant risks involved. After all, I still need to deal with Irenicus and the elves. As a result, Fall has abandoned me, visibly disappointed with my decision.~

@310036 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

A projection of Alendir has appeared, indicating that the Ice Rose was about to melt, which would mean the portal to Rachnidra would open. However, he mentioned that this portal would only be a gateway to the Abyss and that there would be no turning back once crossing its threshold. Alendir is confident that we will find a way to return and that even in the darkest corners of the Abyss, potential allies might be found. He also mentioned that we must start the mission before rescuing Suldanessellar, otherwise, the portal might close forever. The Ice Rose has finally melted: the portal will be found in the sewers of the Lower City of Athkatla, in the chamber of Icelock, the ice golem we defeated in the past.~

@310037 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We have arrived at Rachnidra, the Abyss of Spiders. We find ourselves in a sort of camp where a Wererrat was "having lunch." Apparently, the place serves as some kind of spider feeding ground. However, we haven't spotted any enemies around, which is strange and disturbing. Despite not being certain if Phillipe was a spider agent or not, I chose to end his life. One can never be too sure who to trust when in the Abyss.~

@310038 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We have arrived at Rachnidra, the Abyss of Spiders. We find ourselves in a sort of camp where a Wererrat named Phillipe was "having lunch." Apparently, the place serves as some kind of spider feeding ground. However, we haven't spotted any enemies around, which is strange and disturbing. Phillipe has provided useful information about the cave: the southwestern cave leads to a passage that, in turn, leads to the lair of a monster named Skel'Tharant. The eastern cave would lead to the Spider Queen's chamber. Both places are currently inaccessible, so we are left with only one option: the northern cave, where a sorceress might provide useful information. Before accessing her Enclave, Phillipe mentioned that we would need to defeat her guardians. I wonder what kind of enemies await us...~


@310039 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We have arrived at the Enclave of Vidomina, a lich sorceress of Wee Jas. Despite her undead nature, neither Vidomina nor her minions have shown hostility towards us. In fact, they have provided important information about an abyssal war between two realms: Dreach-naga and Rachnidra. Apparently, this war has been ongoing for years with bloody battles between the reptiles and the spiders. We will need to intervene in this war by reaching the chambers of Tisiphone, the Queen of the Reptiles. We need her blood or her heart to access Morgrath's chambers. Vidomina has said that reasoning with the Medusa will be impossible, so she recommended that we eliminate her and return to the Enclave.~

@310040 = ~Xsi: The Six Tomes of the Abyss

Xsi has tasked us with finding the six books he has written about the Abyss. There are three tomes of Dreach-naga and three tomes of Rachnidra. If we find all six books and bring them to him, the lich has promised a reward. We will likely find the tomes scattered throughout the Abyss.~

@310041 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We have encountered the first line of defense of Dreach-naga. Unfortunately, the rest of the areas will be prepared for our arrival. We must be cautious until we reach Tisiphone's Throne. The General of the reptile forces is a lizardman named Cho'Nuja. He is the one who has ordered the defenses against us and will alert his other captains about our imminent arrival.~

@310042 = ~Phillipe: A Home for the Wererrat

We have arrived at Phillipe's Refuge in Dreach-naga. Strangely, it is a place where we can rest undisturbed and is not of interest to the lizards. After speaking with Phillipe, he revealed that while the Refuge is safe, he does not like living alone. He told us he lost his siblings in the spider caves and, although he is safe (for now), he would like me to live with him. Since it is not feasible for me to live with a Wererrat, I offered to speak with Vidomina to see if she could adopt him into her Enclave. I should return to the Enclave and speak to the lich on behalf of good Phillipe.~

@310043 = ~Phillipe: A Home for the Wererrat

I have spoken to Vidomina about Phillipe's desire for a new home. To my surprise, she had the same desire but her attempts to approach the Wererrat had failed due to his fear of undead creatures. She gave me a talisman to give to him so he could enter the Enclave. What I need to do now is head back to the Refuge with the talisman and deliver the good news to Phillipe.~


@310044 = ~Phillipe: A Home for the Wererrat

I have given the Talisman to Phillipe so he can enter Vidomina's Enclave. Now, the Wererrat should be able to feel safer among powerful allies in a place that cannot be invaded by enemies.~

@310045 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We arrived at the next area in Dreach-naga. This time Cho'Nuja was accompanied by one of his commanders, a yuan-ti named Vreshnak. She commands an experienced group of warriors and serpentine creatures. We need to obtain her wardstone if we want to reach Cho'Nuja.~

@310046 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We are at the lightning portal area, and the battle against General Cho'Nuja has begun. We must defeat him and obtain his wardstone if we want to reach the Marsh of Rask'tar Krathiss.~

@310047 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We have defeated Cho'Nuja, although he escaped through the portal. However, we managed to take his wardstone, so we can now reach the Marsh of Rask'tar Krathiss. He warned us that the Champion of Dreach-naga has never been defeated.~

@310048 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We finally reached Tisiphone's Throne. However, we fell into a trap. After witnessing the fatal blow that Cho'Nuja received from his Queen, she launched an offensive she had prepared against us. We must eliminate everyone and obtain the medusa's heart if we want to succeed in our quest.~

@310049 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We have defeated Tisiphone and the last remnants of the Dreach-naga forces. Cho'Nuja, in his last words, wished us to use the Queen's heart to avenge the fall of his Kingdom. Apparently, the lizardman understood that we had no other option but a bloody confrontation to eliminate a much greater threat. After this, Cho'Nuja has died. We only need to return to Vidomina to see how we should proceed.~


@310050 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

Cho'Nuja, who was the General of Tisiphone's forces, will help us in the fight against the Spiders. However, if I do not heal his mortal wounds, he will die. I need to find a potion called the Bog Brine. According to the General, it is in the possession of the Hydra named Rask'tar Krathiss.~

@310051 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

Cho'Nuja, who was the General of Tisiphone's forces, will help us in the fight against the Spiders. I have given him a strange potion called the Bog Brine, which has completely healed his mortal wounds. Now we need to plan our next move.~

@310052 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

Cho'Nuja's wounds have been healed thanks to the Bog Brine. We had a brief conversation in which he warned us that the spiders will not let us reach Vidomina's Enclave easily. The return journey will be arduous and dangerous.~

@310053 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

Upon leaving Tisiphone's Throne, we encountered Mesothel, the phase spider, and Liphix, a giant spider. Both are offspring of Morgrath and have stolen our wardstones and talismans that allowed us to move through Dreach-naga. Mesothel mentioned that she left Cho'Nuja's Wardstone with one of her Weavers, who is in the Marsh. We will need to kill her and recover it if we want to return to the portal and head towards Vidomina's Enclave.~

@310054 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

Cho'Nuja has told us something terrifying: Morgrath's firstborn cannot die. Or at least not permanently. This means that if we defeat them, it is very likely that we will encounter them again in the future. Cho believes that the source of the spiders' power and vitality is their queen, Morgrath. If we defeat her, it is likely that the victory will be absolute.~


@310055 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

While trying to reach Vidomina's Enclave, I accidentally attacked Cho'Nuja. Surprised, he abandoned us, saying he would not attack us because we saved his life. However, he wished that our paths would not cross again.~

@310056 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

Finally, Morgrath appeared before us after we defeated one of her offspring, Arhtrom, and obtained Vreshnak's wardstone. Morgrath is a colossal creature of immense power. A giant demonic spider. She left the battlefield after testing our strength, saying we would meet again soon. I think our path to the Enclave will be more difficult than expected.~

@310057 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

The path to the Enclave is becoming more complicated. After acquiring Qyl'tar's wardstone, Morgrath appeared again. She offered a strange deal for me to become one of her spawn. Of course, I politely declined the offer, and now we must defeat her once more.~

@310058 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We obtained the Dreach-naga Talisman, but not before fighting Morgrath once more. She said something about how winning battles means little if the war is lost. It might just be nonsense, but we should be alert for what happens when we reach the Enclave.~

@310059 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

We have finally returned to Vidomina's Enclave with the Heart of Tisiphone. Vidomina told us that she will forge a Lantern from the Medusa's heart's blood. With it, we will be able to enter the Spider Queen's Lair. For now, we'll have to wait a few hours while the lich finishes enchanting it. We should use this time to trade and rest.~

@310060 = ~Dreach-naga: The Heart of Tisiphone

Vidomina has used the Heart of Tisiphone to forge the Dreach-naga Lantern. We will use its light to enter the Spider Queen's chambers and put an end to this abyssal war.~


@310061 = ~Skel'Tharant: Champion of Rachnidra

Vidomina has advised us to deal with Rachnidra's Champion before our final confrontation with Morgrath. The lich believes that eliminating the monster will make the fight against the Spider Queen less dangerous, as leaving it alive could lead to it being summoned as an ally in battle once we are in Morgrath's Lair. Vidomina has created a magical Fluorite to guide us to Skel'Tharant's Lair, which is located in the southwestern caves of the Spider Tunnels.~

@310062 = ~Skel'Tharant: Champion of Rachnidra

Vidomina mentioned knowing a method to weaken Skel'Tharant in combat, but for this, we need the help of Phillipe, the Wererrat. I managed to convince him to assist us, so Vidomina will provide him with a type of magical oil. Phillipe will apply this oil during our fight against Skel'Tharant. The oil's effects should inflict a severe wound on the beast, causing irreparable damage to its regenerative abilities. I hope Vidomina is right. And I hope Phillipe won't fail us.~

@310063 = ~Skel'Tharant: Champion of Rachnidra

Skel'Tharant has been defeated, and Morgrath will no longer have his assistance in the final battle.~

@310064 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

Due to my decision to retain my spoils from the fight against Tisiphone and her hydra, Cho'Nuja has left the Enclave and headed to Dreach-naga to spend his final moments.~

@310065 = ~Cho'Nuja: The Wildguard

I have delivered the Dreach-naga Trident and the head of Rask'tar to rally Cho'Nuja's commanders. The General has managed to convince them to join the final fight, so when we reach Morgrath's Lair, Qyl'tar, Vreshnak, and Gassthon will also be there for the final battle against Rachnidra.~

@310066 = ~Xsi: The Six Tomes of the Abyss

I have delivered the six tomes of the Abyss to Xsi. In return, he has given us the limb of a magical longbow. He mentioned that the string is somewhere in the Abyss, as it was removed by its dying owner. If we find the string, Tamika will be able to restore the bow.~


@310067 = ~Xsi: The Six Tomes of the Abyss

Tamika has managed to reconstruct the composite longbow known as Tempestas with supernatural speed. It has proven to be a worthwhile investment to gather those books.~

@310068 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We have fought against Morgrath and her minions in her Abyssal Lair. The Spider Queen seemed on the verge of recovering, but Gemystara used much of her power to banish her from this abyssal layer. With Morgrath's physical death, Vidomina has appeared and is willing to take us back to Faerûn once we speak with her.~

@310069 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We have finally returned to Athkatla, thanks to the last fragment of power from Vidomina's Enclave core. The portal to Rachnidra no longer works, and our adventure has ended in a victory against Morgrath, the Spider Queen.~

@310070 = ~Rachnidra: The Abyssal Spider Pits

We encountered a creature named Mesothel, a giant spider from the Abyss who seemed to have been waiting for my arrival at the Prison of the Wizard. She doesn't seem to have any connection with the Hooded Mages or Bodhi. However, she seemed aware of my divine lineage. Unfortunately, we couldn't defeat her, and as a result, the creature escaped, prophesizing a future reunion. She mentioned that we might find a portal to her Realm in the sewers of the Copper Coronet. If we return at some point, we could go there, as the monster said her kind would soon invade this plane.~


// EPILOGUES ---> FALL 1
// Base Ending
@220006 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Fall returned to her homeland, Imnescar. For a time, she attempted to forge a new home, allowing her memories to resurface and provide the peace she so longed for. However, that idea did not last. News reached her of Zentharim forces invading Mir, with the ambition of subjugating Tethyr. She joined her loyal companions, Daren and Sinna, and provided aid in the battle against the Blood Swords. Support forces from Cormyr arrived, and Fall led the crossbowmen squadron. After a few years, they finally managed to drive away that threat.

The nations of Amn and Tethyr recognized Fall's efforts as the representative of Imnescar and offered her a pack of scouts dedicated to stopping the trade of exotic animals in the region. For years, Fall fought against slavers and made a name for herself among the bravest half-elves of Faerûn.~

// EPILOGUES ---> FALL 2
// Canon Ending
@220007 = ~Having saved her mother with the help of <CHARNAME> gave Fall a new perspective on life. She developed a desire to visit Gemystara's homeland, Evereska, leading her plans there, among the High Elves. Having gained great fame for her connection with the Astral Plane, the selu'taar took her as a student, the heir of Gemystara and friend of Alendir, the Frostmaster. After a few years, she decided to perform a powerful ritual to permanently bring all her summons to the Material Plane. 
She traveled with her friends to Imnescar, fighting against poachers along the way, until she encountered the Crimmor rangers. Tabitha was reunited with Ivor, the Beastmaster who raised her, and together they protected the forests of Tethyr until they received the call of Malar. Kakuto was taken to the Amtar forests, which have a suitable tropical climate for the giant beetle. Fall entrusted his care to the wild elves of the region. Kitochi spent the rest of his days with Fall until Silvanus's call took him to his friend, Aeris, where it is said they wander the lush, pure paths of the Summer Oak. Daren and Sinna returned to run through the forests of Imnescar with their sister, Fall.

After Morgrath's defeat, the land in Imnescar became fertile again, and within a few months, people returned to rebuild their abandoned homes. Fall was part of the rebirth of her homeland, and the wolf became the emblem of hope for the forest's inhabitants.

It is said that when Fall died, after a long life of peace, she, along with her beloved animals, dwelled in the immortal woods of the Father Oak, reuniting with Gerwulf and Gemystara and spending countless autumn sunsets under the soft light of the sun that illuminated the meadows and hills of Tir na Og.~


// EPILOGUES ---> DUSK
// Epílogo 1 -> Neutral Dusk - Mercader

@330006 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Dusk headed to Athkatla. He tried to set up a shop to buy and sell strange artifacts and even received advice from Ribald Barterman. However, his venture failed as he spent most of his time mediating between the Shadow Thieves and the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, avoiding several conflicts. This, along with the deeds he accomplished with <CHARNAME>, earned him several invitations to perform military jobs.

Finally, he answered Thethyr's call to serve as the general of Zaranda Star's armies. It is said that he only asked for the Queen's favor in return to eliminate all necromantic forces in the region.

With bravery, he led the armies of Ternan Grannox and maintained peace for many years until his retirement when he could no longer wield a sword and his quarterstaff had no purpose other than to serve as his third leg.

It is said that he spent his final days in peace under the dim twilight of a rebuilt Darromar.~

// Epílogo 2 -> Neutral Dusk - Dragon Purple Knight

@330007 = ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed towards Cormyr.

There, he narrated everything that had happened since his departure, expecting to receive a deserved punishment for his long absence. Far from it, the High Sword of the Order restored his position as First Sword and assigned a new detachment to recover the bodies of the fallen soldiers, now found in Shilmista.

Not only did he accomplish that, but he also hunted down the orcs responsible for the attack. The battle took place in a mound infested with trolls, with the Knights of the Order of the Purple Dragon emerging victorious. Dusk defeated the orc chieftain Alabarza in a single combat, also killing dozens of his minions. None of his soldiers fell in that battle, and this feat earned him a promotion to Sword Captain.

He was known for being a staunch hunter of necromancers and liches, freeing his nation from many potential threats. After many years of service, he decided to retire.

Rumors have it that he married a beautiful woman from Suzail and restored the Aldant family castle on the outskirts of Arabel. During his years of peace, he had only one daughter whom he named Celine.~

// Epílogo 3 -> Good Dusk - Mielikki's Church

@330008 = ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Dusk made his way towards Shilmista. There, he retrieved the bodies of fallen Cormyrean soldiers with the permission of the elven king Elbereth. He then traveled with an escort of rangers to Cormyr.

Upon arrival, he exposed everything that had happened to the high-ranking army officials, offering to accept whatever punishment they deemed appropriate. However, the general of the Purple Dragons, seeing that one of his First Swords had forged a good relationship with the elves of Shilmista, decided to forgive him on behalf of the king.

The funeral arrangements for the fallen soldiers were a beautiful scene, filled with solemnity and nostalgia. At the end, the elves indicated that a trade alliance between Cormyr and Shilmista would be most beneficial for everyone.

This pleased the nobles greatly, who demanded a large reward for Ardusk Aldant. But he refused, stating that he would be more than happy to build a church to Mielikki and teach about her dogma there.

Cormyr agreed, and thus began the alliance between the northern men and the southern elves.

Rumors say that Dusk spent the rest of his life in the King's Forest in Cormyr, loving nature as his wife had taught him. Perhaps, when his time comes, he can reunite with her in the Unicorn Meadows in the Lady's Forest and there, merge into an eternal embrace of love.~

// Epílogo 4 -> Good Dusk - Alabarza's Death

@330009 = ~After separating from <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed towards Shilmista. It is said that he studied with several elven wizards and searched for an answer to an inner restlessness for a long time.

Years later, he traveled to Athkatla and sought out Falon and his tribe. There he spoke with Sir Ryan Trawl and explained what he was trying to do. Although the paladin did not agree with Dusk's plans, he ultimately allowed Falon and the others to accompany him on a 'small' journey.

Together, they traveled through the lands of Amn and Tethyr, bearing the emblems of the Radiant Heart of Tyr to avoid attacks from local forces. Their destination led them to the Troll Mound on the edge of the Druidic Grove.

Dusk performed a complex ritual to the gods of nature and used much of the power he had gained through the Emerald Orb. At the end, Alabarza and his minions had been resurrected.

Alabarza, surprised to be alive again (and even more so seeing that his great enemy had revived him), asked, "Why did you do this, soldier?".

It is said that Dusk only smiled and said that Gruumsh's eternal punishment seemed too excessive to him.

After several hours of conversations between the humanoids, Dusk managed to convince Alabarza and his tribe to redeem their acts, acting as the first defense of Amn, alongside Falon's tribe.

Alabarza finally agreed and the rest of his tribe followed him. It is said that after a few months, he fell in love with Falon and proposed marriage to her, under the light of his new god: Tyr.

As for Dusk, it is said that he traveled to many places, protecting the weak at the first opportunity. He was able to obtain forgiveness in Cormyr, restore the curse in the Trinity Castle with the help of Elbereth and Mathyus and visit Michelson and Demolisher in Shilmista.

Years passed and when his time was coming, somewhere in the King's Forest in Cormyr, a divine light emerged from a hollow oak tree. Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest, came out of it and carried a tired and worn Ardusk Aldant in her arms.

It is said that they crossed the light of the oak and traveled across oceans of stars until they reached the Unicorn Meadow. There, a shining effigy appeared before him: He was no longer old, his wrinkles and bodily pains had disappeared; and in front of him, a beautiful elf with hair as golden as the sun smiled at him.

"Celine..." he whispered. And he went to her, embracing her while the wild harmony around him danced in an autumn breeze. Now, Dusk and Celine would be together forever.~

// Epílogo 5 -> Good Dusk - Bellfame's War

@330010 = ~The Year of the Tankard was passing in the world when Kartlzer, the Imperceptor Knight of Zentharim, invaded the Mir Forest. He crossed the forest's boundaries and ventured in to take refuge from the troops of Thethyr, with whom they would soon be at war.

His mage sensed the presence of a powerful nymph, whom they could use, alive or dead, for their cruel purposes. It was then that Kartlzer advanced to the heart of the forest with a mage and twenty warriors.

Upon reaching a glaucous mangrove, the villains encountered a particular effigy: the nymph, Bellfame, awaited them surrounded by a bear, three wolves, and a small mouse on her shoulder.

Kartlzer stepped forward and demanded the surrender of the nymph, in exchange for not killing her beasts. However, the nymph, silent, only watched him with some suspicion. It was then that Kartlzer noticed another presence.

From the shadows, a knight in green and purple armor, with the symbol of the Purple Dragon on his chest, appeared.

"I am Ardusk Aldant, First Sword of Cormyr, Knight of the Order of the Purple Dragons and Guardian of Shilmista. If you want to leave here alive, turn around... otherwise, you and all your men will die here, today."

Kartlzer had heard about him and his exploits with <CHARNAME>. It could very well be a trick, but something in Dusk's figure convinced him otherwise.

Finally, the Imperceptor Knight turned around and left quickly from where he came.

Dusk looked at his closed fist in surprise. He opened it, but there was nothing there: The Forest Ring of Mir was in his hand and had disappeared.

Bellfame smiled for the first time: "You did it, Ardusk. You saved us... you changed my fate."

Both embraced and there, Bellfame loved a mortal for the first time.

Dusk spent the rest of his days in Mir with the beasts and plants of the forest he loved so much.~

// Epílogo 6 -> Evil Dusk - NO tiene espada escarlata (Mata a Sothillis)

@330011 = ~After his separation from <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed to Tethyr. There, he founded a mercenary company called the Scarlet Guard and placed himself under the command of Zaranda Star, protecting the region from potential enemies. But rumors indicate that Dusk, a few years later, instigated the start of the war against the Sothillis Empire. The conflict resulted in the loss of thousands of soldiers on both sides. It is said that the war ended in a bloody battle between the humanoids and the Scarlet Guard, in which Sothillis fell in battle against a warrior wielding a sword as red as blood.

The rumors gained strength when, in times of peace, Dusk visited Baldur's Gate and left a large blood-stained greatsword there. Experts later said that it was the personal weapon of the ogre mage Sothillis, a giant humanoid who fell in the aforementioned battle.

As the years passed, Dusk's actions became more erratic and mysterious. He never parted with his sword, which seemed to grow stronger with each death he caused. Finally, the scarlet glow of his sword faded away, indicating the end of the Cormyrean warrior's life. It is said that a great shadow, calling himself Danctian, came to take him in his last moments of life.

The last remnants of Dusk were nothing more than shadow and dust, but some arcane scholars mention that they can find a familiar and eerie presence in the Pandemonium plane.~


// Epílogo 7 -> Evil Dusk - Tiene espada escarlata (Redención)

@330012 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Dusk returned to Athkatla, specifically to an abandoned house in the Docks.

There, he performed a ritual with Danctian and, giving away much of his power, he was able to bring three shilmist creatures back to life. Mathyus, Michelson, and Demolisher were back, confused by Dusk's decision (who had annihilated them in the first place). They received no response and Dusk, along with his demonic shadow, disappeared forever from Amn.

It is said that a scarlet figure with the emblem of Cormyr helped Tethyr combat the threat of the Ogre Mage Sothillis. Then, he traveled to Shilmista to visit the tomb of an she-elf archer and finally visited a cursed place called the Castle Trinity.

There, he performed a forbidden ritual in which he opened a portal to a forest plane. He made a pact with the Lady of the Forest herself. Some elven guardians witnessed how the human unsheathed his sword, which was scarlet as blood, but gradually, it turned grey like the leaves of a cedar tree. A powerful gale invaded the place and the gleam of the sword vanished, just like Dusk's life.

When the elves returned to Shilmista to inform Elbereth, he was already dealing with a supernatural event. Celine, the elven archer, had revived.

Celine, still shaken by what had happened, immediately headed to Trinity. There, she could not find Dusk's body. She only found a staff with the emblem of Shilmista and an armor with the emblem of Cormyr. These artifacts are still guarded with great care to this day in the heart of Shilmista.~


// Epilogue 1 -> Cho'Nuja - Base Ending
// Marsh of Chelimber -> Marsh of Chelimber

@720000 = ~Cho'Nuja reunited with his commanders, Qyl'tar, Vreshnak, and Gassthon, who were with the sorceress Vidomina. Along with the lich, they traveled through various parts of Faerûn, attempting to find a suitable home for the Dreach-naga reptiles.

Eventually, they settled in the Marsh of Chelimber, where they tried to make amends with the lizardfolk of Najara. However, to Cho's dismay, they were more than willing to declare war against Evereska and Elturgard. After tense years of a fragile peace, Cho managed to become the liaison between the human and lizard nations, where they agreed to live without hostilities as long as the inhabitants of Najara were left in peace. Cho'Nuja, along with his friends, finally achieved the peaceful life he had longed for when he lived in the Abyss.~

// Epilogue 2 -> Cho'Nuja - Canon Ending
// Marsh of Chelimber -> Marsh of Chelimber

@720001 = ~Cho'Nuja reunited with his commanders, Qyl'tar, Vreshnak, and Gassthon, who were with the sorceress Vidomina. Along with the lich, they traveled through various parts of Faerûn, attempting to find a suitable home for the Dreach-naga reptiles.

For years, Cho and his company roamed the southwestern lands of the continent. The Marsh of Chelimber seemed like a good place to settle, however, Cho was not satisfied with the mindset of the Najara denizens. He challenged the strongest in combat, and his techniques from the Jon Clan of Dreach-naga prevailed with fervor and power. He then used his commanders and Vidomina's warriors to sow peace in the surrounding regions, rescuing caravans from monsters like manticores or hostile undead. When rumors of a new peaceful leader spread in Elturgard and Evereska, Cho introduced himself to the ambassadors of these cities. He established a peace treaty between the three nations and committed to teaching the Common and Chondathan languages (which he had learned quickly during his stay in Najara) to the inhabitants of the Marsh. Nagas, lizardfolk, and yuan-ti lived in peace with humans and elves from the southwestern regions.

Jon Cho'Nuja had forged his realm of peace in the southern marshes of Faerûn and preserved the legacy of Dreach-naga that he cherished so much.~

// Epílogo 1 -> Alendir - Base Ending

@720002 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Alendir returned to Evereska. Many acquaintances and mentors were surprised by his youthful condition despite having departed as an old man (at least in appearance). However, the more perceptive wizards had followed his journey through Tethyr with interest as the Selu'taar had reached a high level of power. He was accepted into the Academy of Magic as a specialist in frost magic, but he soon became bored with the task.

With his renewed energy after his resurrection, he left the Hidden Realm once again to venture into the lands of the Sword Coast. He eventually decided to establish a school of magic for summoners near the ruins of Ulcaster. To the surprise of many of his acquaintances, Alendir taught his magic to many humans and half-elves, taking great care to ensure they did not stray from the path of Mystra. After training many well-regarded summoners and conjurers, he chose to spend his last decades in Myth Drannor, where he found peace until his return to the arms of the Goddess of Magic.~
